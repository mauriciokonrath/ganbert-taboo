UNK:UNK	Here is our forecast	4
UNK:UNK	Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.  As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.    My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.	140
UNK:UNK	test successful.  way to go!!!	5

UNK:UNK	George,   Here sales numbers from Reagan:        As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The  1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the  units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units  under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with  competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals  actually done to date.      Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call  about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was  rejected on the De Ville property.  Phillip Allen	124
UNK:UNK	Jeff,   What is up with Burnet?  Phillip	7
UNK:UNK	Jeff,   I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written  approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has  concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.    I would also like  to review the closing statements as soon as possible.  Phillip	52
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  I want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. I faxed you a copy  of this file.  You can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct  amounts and I will input.	39
UNK:UNK	Brenda,   I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on  August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I  will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can  treat the 2nd as payment for October.   I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without  getting the details and getting your approval.   I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.  Phillip	84

UNK:UNK	Jeff,   You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood.     I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which   I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering  properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you  perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a  project from scratch?   I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.    Phillip	85

UNK:UNK	Larry,   Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development  opportunities.   I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were  built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for   around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated  that he had more units under construction that would be   available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different  from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor  plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.     As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.     Call or email with your thoughts.  Phillip	120

UNK:UNK	Mark,   Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal  basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that  reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints  before and after bidweek.             The following observations can be made:    July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs  actual of .79    2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91    3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.    Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs  actual of .99    2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49    3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the  monthly postings    4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.        Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against  the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any  questions.  Phillip	171

UNK:UNK	Brad,   With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial  manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an  associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a  commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to  others in that category at year end.     Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.   Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.   Let me know if there are any issues.  Phillip	90
UNK:UNK	Bruce,  Can you stop by and set up my reuters.  Phillip	11
UNK:UNK	Lucy,   The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add  these modifications:   1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It  should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.   2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.   =e6-g6.   3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width  is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the         letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.   4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to  this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.  Phillip	129
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  I got your email with the attachment.  Let's work together today to get this  done  Phillip	18

UNK:UNK	Lucy,   We can discuss your email later.  How is progress on creating the  spreadsheets.  You will probably need to close the file before you attach to  an email.  It is 2:00.  I really want to make some progress on these two  files.  Phillip	44

UNK:UNK	Mac,   Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:    Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year      Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf    Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.      Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:   (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS  X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share    That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think  crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.   Current price 37  Nat. Gas 34  Crude  10   Total  81     Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this  looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine,  Tosco, and SLB?   Thank you,   Phillip	152

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  I got your email.  I didn't have time to finish it.  I will read it this  weekend and ask my dad about the a/c's.  I am glad you are enjoying the job.  This weekend I will mark up the lease and rules.  If I didn't  mention this when I was there, the 4th is a paid holiday for you and Wade.   Have a good weekend and I will talk to you next week.

The enclosed version contains deltas and decision  variable.   You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so. This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the model.  I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor. The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation very well.  The Enron Research storage model  is a lot like that, although  implementation may be different.

UNK:UNK	Scott,   I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think  I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from  him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some  price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large  enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.   The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage  the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.  Phillip	105
UNK:UNK	Lucy,   I want to speak to Wade myself.  He can call me at work or home. Or if you  email me his number I will call him.    I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him  work orders for normal maintenance.   I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office.  Do you need Mary  to come in on any more Fridays?  I think I   can guess your answer.   I might stop by this Friday.  Phillip	83

UNK:UNK	Ned,  Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.  Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.  I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.  Phillip Allen	129

UNK:UNK	Jeff,   I will respond to the offer on Monday.  There is a $35 Million expansion  adding 250 jobs in Burnet.  I am tempted to hold for $3000/acre.  Owner  financing would still work.   Do you have an opinion?  Phillip	39
UNK:UNK	Al,  I was glad to hear from you.  I hope we can put the past behind us.  Sounds  like you have been busy.  Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your  email all is well with you.   That's great.    We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.   What's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike  riding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.  My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on  maintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical  cyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.   He never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial  Park on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the  road.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.  I would like to hear more about your new job.  Maybe we could grab lunch  sometime.    Phillip	187
UNK:UNK	Mary,  If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6  or 12 months.  6 month payout would be $190/month.   12 month payout would be $95/month.  Your choice.  I would like it if you  could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so.  Does $10/hr sound  fair?  We can apply it to the loan.  Phillip	67

They were polite regarding  asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to  listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to  protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality  agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable  us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder  value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by  reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a  weather product.  As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other  candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy  to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our  opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we  implement our strategy in California.  Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset  management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to  systematically identify and work through all the candidates.   Laird	226

UNK:UNK	$100 for the yard seems like enough for up to 12.5 hours.  How long did it  take him?  I think $100 should be enough.   Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if  you want to change from printing vertically  to printing horizontally.  Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want  your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print preview to see what your print out will look like before you print.  The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  A valve  adjustment might do some good.  It has idled very high for the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.

UNK:UNK	Frank,  The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.    Phillip	73

UNK:UNK	Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.   Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding  the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business  meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is  even desired or necessary.  As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try  and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working  and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet  just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a  round table discussion format.    My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and  jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.	140

UNK:UNK	Tim,  Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our  Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.  On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its  forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been  lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the  second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The  outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some  additional insight?  Thank you,  Phillip	102
UNK:UNK	Gary,  I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general  contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from  the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within  his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe  he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.    Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from  the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you  please email them to me as well?  Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.  Phillip Allen	119

UNK:UNK	Ned,  Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for  this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current  summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made  to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal  capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and  withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60  existed at the time of this bid.  Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above  assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.  I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email  with comments.  Phillip Allen	129
UNK:UNK	Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?   Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed  price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?	36
UNK:UNK	Gary,  Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X  41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story  porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the  front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.

UNK:UNK	Johnnie,  Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic  about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels  into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my  budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing  the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.   However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.  I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this  product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you  that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously  consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in  cost over stick built.

UNK:UNK	Johnnie,  Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.  I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.  Please email your cost estimates when complete.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen	154

UNK:UNK	Larry,  It sounds like Claudia and Jacques are almost finished with the documents.   There is one item of which I was unsure.

You can give out my work numer (713) 853-7041  Phillip	65
UNK:UNK	Thanks for your help.	4
UNK:UNK	Jed,  Thanks for the response.    Phillip Allen	7
UNK:UNK	Reagan,  I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on  Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned  I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get  back in touch with you once he is finished.  Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager  from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable  with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp  Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid  for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am  still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local  relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final  determination on unit mix and site plan.  Phillip Allen	152
UNK:UNK	"Jacques,  The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows:  Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225  is outstanding.  Kohutek- $2,150   Cuatro- $37,800   George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this  amount.  The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500  appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this  cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.  Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the   sellers to be executed.  Phillip"	113
UNK:UNK	John,  Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith  said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should  receive the same signing incentives as Keith.    Phillip	33
UNK:UNK	Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is  the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the  floor plan. He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and  improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While  he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification  list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and  speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday  April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through  that day?  Also can you provide some references?  Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust  your bid.    Phillip	146

UNK:UNK	Reagan,  I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.  Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?  What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA  221(d) loans?    Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market  quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:    5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment   2%- overhead   4%- profit  I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an  extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even  reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only  generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about  such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down  to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?  I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you  local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of  the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.  Phillip	199
UNK:UNK	Chad,  Call Ted Bland about the trading track program.  All the desks are trying to use this program to train analysts to be traders.  Your experience should help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary. Unless you are dying to do another rotation is risk.  Phillip	49

UNK:UNK	Larry,  Jacques has sent a document to Claudia for your review.  Just dropping you a  line to confirm that you have seen it.  Phillip	24
UNK:UNK	Jacques,  Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and  architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written  personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the  engineer. I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the  partnership.    I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the  partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been  conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.  Let me know what you think.  Phillip	116

UNK:UNK	Greg,  Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:  Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf  (rentable)  What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?  Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2%  overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.  Why is profit only 4%?   Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.  What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to  boost loan amount but not a real cost?  Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who  receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?  Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?  What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts  NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40%  expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage  would only be 1.16.  Talk to you this afternoon.  Phillip	189

UNK:UNK	John,  Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of  course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing  contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still  wants to receive this payment.  Phillip	49
UNK:UNK	Reagan,   Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

UNK:UNK	Greg,  Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to  replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than  the full replatting process of 3 weeks?  Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the  plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes  across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for  the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.  Phillip	90
UNK:UNK	keith holst sent you an email with the details.	9
UNK:UNK	"Jacques,  The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might  object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the  construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs  of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the  loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of  equity that would be required.   Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.  Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans,  engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are  in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking  directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on  what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.    The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we  need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and  give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.  Phillip"	181

UNK:UNK	Jacques,  I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of  value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to  use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey,  appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in  extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like  earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I  didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear  this up.  Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.   Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and  the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand,  conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was  clean.  What is your inclination?  Call as soon as you have a chance to review.  Phillip	169

According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.  Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however.  More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter."	238
UNK:UNK	Thanks for the information.  It would be helpful if you would send the  detailed worksheet that you mentioned.  I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones  granted this January.  I have always elected to defer any distributions of  restricted stock.  I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be  kept in enron stock (50%).   Are you saying that all the previous grants have  fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?  Thank you for looking into this issue.  Phillip	87

UNK:UNK	Darrell,  Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his  excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the  land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like  to proceed and develop the property.    My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would  also like to compare construction and development services between what you  can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.   Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to  be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural  work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is  Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about  either.  I look forward to working with you.

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:  #2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is  not on any rentroll that I can see.  #9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she  will start paying on #9  #15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to  collect the $95 in question.  #33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?  #26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.   Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.  #44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of  the year.  #33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't  see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?  The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to  figure these out immediately.  I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll  in case you need to research these questions.  I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be  able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary  on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.

First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in the transaction.  2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC)  will be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal.  3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as deferred profit has been acceptable.  Thanks,  Andrew Ozuna Real Estate Loan Officer 210-271-8386 ##	208

UNK:UNK	"John,  Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies  forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.  Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:  1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS,  TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the         parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and  TAGG but the issues facing         scheduling in Unify are grey.  2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up""  policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need  further      scrutiny.  3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical  imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?  4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training  courses, review progress and make cuts.  5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at  everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add     some value and direction to the group.   In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD  to work part time to get it done.  Phillip"	194

UNK:UNK	"Jaques,  After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different  definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a  superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third  party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management""  fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be  paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally  the builders profit of 1.4 million.  Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out  of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if  they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?   We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition  to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been  in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and  the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management  fee is included.  George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will  review and let you know what I think.  The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to  the 3 out 4 approval process.  Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only  true costs + 1.4 million.  Phillip"	252

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject  to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.  It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there  unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.  When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize  that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.    Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes  if you need to.      Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and  refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form  to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this  information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.  It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with  the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  He will know what I  mean.  Talk to you later,  Phillip	201

UNK:UNK	"Lucy,  Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.    There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.  1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank  is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the  spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.  2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?  3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?  4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?  5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?  6.  #14  missed on 2/2?  7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?  8.  #20a missed on 2/2?  9.  #35 missed on 2/2?  My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.   You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on  some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the  bank deposit.  Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade  last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.

UNK:UNK	Jacques,  Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?    The key business points are:  1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate  2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million  3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.  4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?  5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.  With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a  solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes  costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I  would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax  all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the  checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing  but invoices were not being submitted.  Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some  tweaking.    Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 pallen@enron.com	174

UNK:UNK	Jeff,  My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a  sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only  require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I  would net around $20K cash.    You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or  higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the  New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.   Phillip	92
UNK:UNK	Jeff,  I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several  reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the  large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer  are the three biggest concerns.    What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the  buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due  until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the  property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make  the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance  is pushing too far.  Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the  earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?  Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New  Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get  started on the list.  Email or call  me later today.  Phillip	207

UNK:UNK	Jeff,  That is good news about Leander.    Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have  about $225K invested in the stagecoach,   it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.    I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee  and Jaques Craig can  work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a  second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%. Checkout this spreadsheet.      These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.    However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy  show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some  trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the  time and I don't trust  Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from  now on.    I will have the operating statements complete through December by this  Friday.    Phillip	185

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon.  Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626   Phillip	245

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  #32 and #29 are fine.    #28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid  260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He  either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the  middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There  are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all  the cold weather.  You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.   This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.  I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We  also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need  to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write  something today.

UNK:UNK	Questions about 12/29 rentroll:   There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other  for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?   Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For  what periods?    What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!   That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money  and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first  asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like  leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the  apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly  inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has  been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.  I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so  I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this  right?  Has the deposit been made yet?    A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.  Phillip	198

UNK:UNK	Gentlemen,   I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure  and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.  Regarding the financing,  I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.  I have  sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information  on you.  Can you please send it to him.  His contact information is:  phone  (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net.   I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I  hope to pull that together this afternoon.   I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He  was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the  bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.  I think we should discuss  these procedures in advance.   Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.  Phillip	156
UNK:UNK	"Jim,   I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I  described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in  San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a  couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like  to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not  require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to  structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has  been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the  equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this  nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to  permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be  important to banks.    I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer  email or fax his financial statement to you.   Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.   Phillip Allen"	182
UNK:UNK	Jeff,  Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I  have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out  tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility  connections?  Other rezoning costs?    What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I  owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this  property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes  once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him  grazing rights?  What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and  annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and  American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we  are pushing the process as fast as we can.  Phillip	154
UNK:UNK	Steve,   I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If  you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.          As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                     This creates a shortage in later months.   2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                         Specific questions should include:      1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage?    2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system.          I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less.   3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating  rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market  and the       consumer has benefitted.     Call me if you need any more input.   Phillip	242
UNK:UNK	Lucy,   Here is a rentroll for this week.  The one you sent for 11/24 looked good.   It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to  the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the  rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or  $20 to get things full, go ahead.   I will be out of the office on Thursday.  I will talk to you on Friday.  Phillip	87

UNK:UNK	Lucy,   I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated.        The critical information is  1.  Move in or lease start date       2.  Lease expiration date       3.  Rent       4.  Deposit       If you have the info you can   fill in these items  1.  Number of occupants       2.  Workplace           All the new leases should be the long form.     The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated  back in October are  #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38.      I really need to get this by tomorrow.  Please use the rentroll_1215 file to  input the correct information on all these tenants.  And email it to me  tomorrow.  You should have all this information on their leases and  applications.    Phillip	126
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is a new file for 12/15.     For the rentroll for 12/08 here are my questions:   #23 & #24 did not pay.  Just late or moving?   #25 & #33 Both paid 130 on 12/01 and $0 on 12/08.  What is the deal?   #11  Looks like she is caught up.  When is she due again?   Please email the answers.  Phillip	62

Note that the construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.  Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.  It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.  I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are $1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3 bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.      - winmail.dat"	230

UNK:UNK	Dave,  The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars  that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped  from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk  will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.     The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as  follows:  October 2000  $1,395,000 November 2000 $1,350,000 December 2000 $1,395,000 January 2001  $   669,600 February 2001  $   604,800 March 2001  $   669,600 April 2001  $   648,000 May 2001  $   669,600 June 2001  $   648,000 July 2001  $   669,600 August 2001  $   669,600 September 2001 $   648,000 October 2001  $   669,600 November 2001 $   648,000 December 2001 $   669,600  This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by  the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day  (Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA  Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.  Let me know if you disagree.  Phillip	194

UNK:UNK	George,   The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other  investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background  information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.   Background Questions:    Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in  Creekside.   Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project  description, investors, business entity,    Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.   Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on  recent projects.    With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple  of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the  investors.     Preferable Investment Structure:   Developers guarantee note, not investors.   Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.   Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.           Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should  tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in  any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that  leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any  information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.  Sincerely,  Phillip Allen	204
UNK:UNK	Bob,   Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy  Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment  to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM  to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.   If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this  time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.   She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.   Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr.  specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know  what is an acceptable cash amount.  Phillip	126

UNK:UNK	Bob,   Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her  efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the  gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling  group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti  was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she  would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the  traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information  has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size  of the west desk positions.    Please call to discuss cash award.  Phillip	118

UNK:UNK	John,   Denver's short rockies position  beyond 2002 is created by their Trailblazer  transport.  They are unhedged 15,000/d in 2003 and 25,000/d in 2004 and  2005.     They are scrubbing all their books and booking the Hubert deal on Wednesday  and Thursday.  Phillip	46
UNK:UNK	George,   Here sales numbers from Reagan:        As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The  1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the  units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units  under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with  competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals  actually done to date.      Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call  about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was  rejected on the De Ville property.  Phillip Allen	124
UNK:UNK	Jeff,   What is up with Burnet?  Phillip	7
UNK:UNK	Jeff,   I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written  approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has  concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.    I would also like  to review the closing statements as soon as possible.  Phillip	52
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  I want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. I faxed you a copy  of this file.  You can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct  amounts and I will input.	39
UNK:UNK	Brenda,   I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on  August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I  will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can  treat the 2nd as payment for October.   I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without  getting the details and getting your approval.   I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.  Phillip	84

UNK:UNK	Jeff,   You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood.     I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which   I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering  properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you  perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a  project from scratch?   I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.    Phillip	85

UNK:UNK	Larry,   Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development  opportunities.   I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were  built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for   around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated  that he had more units under construction that would be   available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different  from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor  plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.     As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.     Call or email with your thoughts.  Phillip	120

UNK:UNK	Mark,   Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal  basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that  reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints  before and after bidweek.             The following observations can be made:    July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs  actual of .79    2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91    3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.    Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs  actual of .99    2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49    3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the  monthly postings    4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.        Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against  the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.

UNK:UNK	Brad,   With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial  manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an  associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a  commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to  others in that category at year end.     Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.   Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.   Let me know if there are any issues.  Phillip	90
UNK:UNK	Bruce,  Can you stop by and set up my reuters.  Phillip	11
UNK:UNK	Lucy,   The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add  these modifications:   1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It  should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.   2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.   =e6-g6.   3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width  is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the         letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.   4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to  this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.  Phillip	129
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  I got your email with the attachment.  Let's work together today to get this  done  Phillip	18
UNK:UNK	you have my approval	4
UNK:UNK	Lucy,   We can discuss your email later.  How is progress on creating the  spreadsheets.  You will probably need to close the file before you attach to  an email.  It is 2:00.  I really want to make some progress on these two  files.  Phillip	44
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week.   Then email the file back.	21
UNK:UNK	"Open the ""utility"" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it  is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1).

This is a great chance for you to practice  excel."	72
UNK:UNK	Mac,   Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:    Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year      Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf    Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.      Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:   (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS  X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share    That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.

UNK:UNK	Scott,   I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think  I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from  him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some  price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large  enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.   The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage  the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.  Phillip	105
UNK:UNK	Lucy,   I want to speak to Wade myself.  He can call me at work or home. Or if you  email me his number I will call him.    I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him  work orders for normal maintenance.   I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office.  Do you need Mary  to come in on any more Fridays?  I think I   can guess your answer.   I might stop by this Friday.  Phillip	83

What do you think about being open until noon on Saturday.  This might be  more convenient for collecting rent and showing open apartments. We can adjust office hours on another day.  Phillip	64
UNK:UNK	Jeff,   I will respond to the offer on Monday.  There is a $35 Million expansion  adding 250 jobs in Burnet.  I am tempted to hold for $3000/acre.  Owner  financing would still work.   Do you have an opinion?  Phillip	39
UNK:UNK	Al,  I was glad to hear from you.  I hope we can put the past behind us.  Sounds  like you have been busy.  Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your  email all is well with you.   That's great.    We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.   What's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike  riding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.  My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on  maintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical  cyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.   He never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial  Park on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the  road.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.  I would like to hear more about your new job.  Maybe we could grab lunch  sometime.    Phillip	187
UNK:UNK	Mary,  If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6  or 12 months.  6 month payout would be $190/month.   12 month payout would be $95/month.  Your choice.  I would like it if you  could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so.  Does $10/hr sound  fair?  We can apply it to the loan.  Phillip	67

They were polite regarding  asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to  listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to  protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality  agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable  us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder  value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by  reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a  weather product.  As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other  candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy  to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our  opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we  implement our strategy in California.  Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset  management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to  systematically identify and work through all the candidates.   Laird	226

Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want  your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print preview to see what your print out will look like before you print.  The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  A valve  adjustment might do some good.  It has idled very high for the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.  Glad to hear about the good deposit for this week.  Great job on February.  Phillip	135

UNK:UNK	"Folks,  I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I think will be interesting to the group.  I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.  I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks.  Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.   <A HREF=""http://www.romanconcrete.com/"">Roman Concrete Research by David Moore</A>   Regards,  Harry Francis"	181

UNK:UNK	Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.   Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding  the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business  meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is  even desired or necessary.  As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try  and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working  and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet  just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a  round table discussion format.    My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and  jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.	140

UNK:UNK	Send to Karen Buckley.  Trading track interview to be conducted in May.	12
UNK:UNK	Tim,  Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our  Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.  On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its  forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been  lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the  second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The  outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some  additional insight?  Thank you,  Phillip	102
UNK:UNK	I would look at properties in San Antonio or Dallas.	10
UNK:UNK	Gary,  I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general  contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from  the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within  his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe  he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.    Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from  the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you  please email them to me as well?  Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.  Phillip Allen	119
UNK:UNK	"Ray,  Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which  publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification  on the language ""the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in  California""?  Phillip"	43
UNK:UNK	Ned,  Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for  this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current  summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made  to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal  capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and  withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60  existed at the time of this bid.  Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above  assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.  I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email  with comments.  Phillip Allen	129
UNK:UNK	Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?   Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed  price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?	36
UNK:UNK	Gary,  Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X  41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story  porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the  front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The  living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the  front porch.    I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow  and fax you a copy.

UNK:UNK	Frank,  The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially  set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever  the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very  short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not  match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.    Phillip	73

UNK:UNK	Johnnie,  Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic  about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels  into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my  budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing  the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.   However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.  I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this  product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you  that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously  consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in  cost over stick built.  Please email your cost estimates when complete.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen	154

UNK:UNK	Reagan,  I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on  Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned  I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get  back in touch with you once he is finished.  Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager  from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable  with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp  Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid  for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am  still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local  relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final  determination on unit mix and site plan.  Phillip Allen	152
UNK:UNK	"Jacques,  The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows:  Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225  is outstanding.  Kohutek- $2,150   Cuatro- $37,800   George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this  amount.  The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500  appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this  cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.  Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the   sellers to be executed.  Phillip"	113
UNK:UNK	John,  Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith  said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should  receive the same signing incentives as Keith.    Phillip	33
UNK:UNK	Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is  the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the  floor plan. He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and  improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While  he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification  list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and  speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday  April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through  that day?  Also can you provide some references?  Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust  your bid.    Phillip	146

Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the  beginning       of the two week period.  What is going on?  2.  Gilbert in #27-is he just late?    Here is a file for 12/08.	75

UNK:UNK	Jacques  I am out of the office for the rest of the week.  Have you ever seen anyone  miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks?  I assure you this is  unusual for me. Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday.  Call me on my cell phone if  you need me.  Phillip	57
UNK:UNK	Reagan,  I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.  Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?  What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA  221(d) loans?    Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market  quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:    5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment   2%- overhead   4%- profit  I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an  extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even  reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only  generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about  such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down  to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?  I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you  local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of  the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.  Phillip	199

Please let me know if you have any questions.    Tiffany Miller 5-8485	68
UNK:UNK	Jacques,  Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and  architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written  personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the  engineer. I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the  partnership.    I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the  partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been  conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.  Let me know what you think.  Phillip	116

UNK:UNK	Greg,  Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:  Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf  (rentable)  What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?  Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2%  overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.  Why is profit only 4%?   Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.  What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to  boost loan amount but not a real cost?  Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who  receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?  Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?  What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts  NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40%  expenses.

UNK:UNK	John,  Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of  course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing  contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still  wants to receive this payment.  Phillip	49
UNK:UNK	Reagan,   Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.   Specific features include:   Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs  Wood stairs  Two story porches on front and rear  Granite counters in kitchens and baths  Tile floors in upstairs baths  Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)  Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths  Solid wood interior doors  Windows fully trimmed  Crown molding in downstairs living areas  2x6 wall on west side   Undecided items include:   Vinyl or Aluminum windows  Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room  Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4  sides      I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.   The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof,  but   only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.     Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a  box with a simple roof   line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

UNK:UNK	Greg,  Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to  replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than  the full replatting process of 3 weeks?  Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the  plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes  across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for  the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.  Phillip	90

UNK:UNK	"Jacques,  The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might  object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the  construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs  of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the  loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of  equity that would be required.   Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.  Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans,  engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are  in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking  directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on  what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.    The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we  need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and  give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.  Phillip"	181

UNK:UNK	Jacques,  I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of  value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to  use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey,  appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in  extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like  earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I  didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear  this up.  Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.   Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and  the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand,  conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was  clean.  What is your inclination?  Call as soon as you have a chance to review.  Phillip	169

According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.  Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however.  More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter."	238

UNK:UNK	Darrell,  Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his  excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the  land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like  to proceed and develop the property.

I would  also like to compare construction and development services between what you  can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.   Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to  be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural  work to date.

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:  #2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is  not on any rentroll that I can see.  #9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she  will start paying on #9  #15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to  collect the $95 in question.  #33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?  #26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.   Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.  #44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of  the year.  #33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't  see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?  The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to  figure these out immediately.  I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll  in case you need to research these questions.  I will not be in the office next week.

Regarding the differences in the two estimates, I don't want to waste your  time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough.  The  items I listed moved dramatically.  Also, some of the questions were just  clarification of what was in a number.    Let's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow  morning.    Phillip	90
UNK:UNK	George,   The numbers on your fax don't agree to the first estimate that I am using.   Here are the two files I used.       Phillip	25

First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in the transaction.  2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC)  will be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal.  3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as deferred profit has been acceptable.  Thanks,  Andrew Ozuna Real Estate Loan Officer 210-271-8386 ##	208

UNK:UNK	"John,  Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies  forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.  Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:  1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS,  TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the         parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and  TAGG but the issues facing         scheduling in Unify are grey.  2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up""  policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need  further      scrutiny.  3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical  imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?  4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training  courses, review progress and make cuts.  5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at  everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add     some value and direction to the group.   In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD  to work part time to get it done.  Phillip"	194

UNK:UNK	"Jaques,  After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different  definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a  superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third  party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management""  fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be  paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally  the builders profit of 1.4 million.  Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out  of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if  they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?   We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition  to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been  in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and  the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management  fee is included.  George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will  review and let you know what I think.  The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to  the 3 out 4 approval process.  Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only  true costs + 1.4 million.  Phillip"	252

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject  to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.  It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there  unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.  When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize  that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.    Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes  if you need to.      Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and  refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form  to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this  information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.

UNK:UNK	"Lucy,  Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.    There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.  1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank  is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the  spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.  2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?  3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?  4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?  5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?  6.  #14  missed on 2/2?  7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?  8.  #20a missed on 2/2?  9.  #35 missed on 2/2?  My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.   You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on  some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the  bank deposit.  Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade  last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.  I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet  them?  If so, what did you think?  Phillip"	238
UNK:UNK	I will email you an updated operating statement with Nov and Dec tomorrow  morning.  What did the seguin doctor think of the place.    How much could I get the stagecoach appraised for?  Do you still do  appraisals?  Could it be valued on an 11 or 12 cap?	47
UNK:UNK	Jacques,  Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?    The key business points are:  1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate  2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million  3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.  4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?  5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.  With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a  solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes  costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I  would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax  all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the  checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing  but invoices were not being submitted.  Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some  tweaking.    Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 pallen@enron.com	174

UNK:UNK	Jeff,  My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a  sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only  require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I  would net around $20K cash.    You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or  higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the  New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.   Phillip	92
UNK:UNK	Jeff,  I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several  reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the  large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer  are the three biggest concerns.    What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the  buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due  until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the  property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make  the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance  is pushing too far.  Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the  earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?  Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New  Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get  started on the list.  Email or call  me later today.  Phillip	207

UNK:UNK	Jeff,  That is good news about Leander.    Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have  about $225K invested in the stagecoach,   it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.    I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee  and Jaques Craig can  work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a  second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%. Checkout this spreadsheet.      These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.    However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy  show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some  trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the  time and I don't trust  Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from  now on.    I will have the operating statements complete through December by this  Friday.    Phillip	185
UNK:UNK	---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/29/2001  12:14 PM --------------------------- To: <cbpres@austin.rr.com> cc:   Subject: Re: SM134    George,  Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders  profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon.  Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626   Phillip	245

Note that the construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.  Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.  It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.  I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are $1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3 bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.      - winmail.dat"	230

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon.  Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626   Phillip	222
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There  are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all  the cold weather.  You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.   This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.  I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We  also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need  to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write  something today.    Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start  collecting.  Phillip	118

Are you too busy to look at this project?  As I mentioned I  would be interested in speaking to you as an advisor or at least a sounding  board for the key issues.    Please email or call.

UNK:UNK	Questions about 12/29 rentroll:   There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other  for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?   Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For  what periods?    What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!   That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money  and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first  asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like  leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the  apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly  inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has  been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.  I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so  I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this  right?  Has the deposit been made yet?    A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.  Phillip	198

Phillip  P.S.  Please remember to get Jim Murnan the info. he needs.	95
UNK:UNK	Gentlemen,   I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure  and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.  Regarding the financing,  I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.  I have  sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information  on you.  Can you please send it to him.  His contact information is:  phone  (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net.   I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I  hope to pull that together this afternoon.   I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He  was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the  bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.  I think we should discuss  these procedures in advance.   Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.  Phillip	156
UNK:UNK	"Jim,   I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I  described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in  San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a  couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like  to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not  require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to  structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has  been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the  equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this  nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to  permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be  important to banks.    I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer  email or fax his financial statement to you.   Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.   Phillip Allen"	182
UNK:UNK	Jeff,  Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I  have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out  tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility  connections?  Other rezoning costs?    What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I  owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this  property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes  once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him  grazing rights?  What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and  annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and  American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we  are pushing the process as fast as we can.  Phillip	154

UNK:UNK	Steve,   I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If  you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.          As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                     This creates a shortage in later months.   2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                         Specific questions should include:      1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage?    2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system.          I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less.   3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating  rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market  and the       consumer has benefitted.     Call me if you need any more input.   Phillip	242

UNK:UNK	Dave,  The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars  that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped  from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk  will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.     The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as  follows:  October 2000  $1,395,000 November 2000 $1,350,000 December 2000 $1,395,000 January 2001  $   669,600 February 2001  $   604,800 March 2001  $   669,600 April 2001  $   648,000 May 2001  $   669,600 June 2001  $   648,000 July 2001  $   669,600 August 2001  $   669,600 September 2001 $   648,000 October 2001  $   669,600 November 2001 $   648,000 December 2001 $   669,600  This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by  the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day  (Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA  Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.  Let me know if you disagree.  Phillip	194

UNK:UNK	George,   The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other  investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background  information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.   Background Questions:    Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in  Creekside.   Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project  description, investors, business entity,    Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.   Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on  recent projects.    With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple  of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the  investors.     Preferable Investment Structure:   Developers guarantee note, not investors.   Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.   Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.           Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should  tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in  any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that  leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any  information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.  Sincerely,  Phillip Allen	204
UNK:UNK	Bob,   Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy  Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment  to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM  to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.   If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this  time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.   She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.   Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr.  specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know  what is an acceptable cash amount.  Phillip	126
UNK:UNK	Andy,   Please assign a user name to Randy Gay.  Thank you,  Phillip	12
UNK:UNK	Andy,   I spoke to John L. and he ok'd one of each new electronic system for the  west desk.  Are there any operational besides ICE and Dynegy?  If not, can  you have your assistant call me with id's and passwords.  Thank you,  Phillip	45

UNK:UNK	Bob,   Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her  efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the  gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling  group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti  was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she  would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the  traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information  has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size  of the west desk positions.    Please call to discuss cash award.  Phillip	118

UNK:UNK	Bob,   Any time tomorrow between 10 am and 1 pm would be good for looking at the  plans.  As far as the TV's, what do you need me to do?  Do we need plasma  screens or would regular monitors be just as good at a fraction of the cost.  Phillip	51

To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.    The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit."	206

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.  I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.

UNK:UNK	The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.    As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.  Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.

UNK:UNK	Dear West,  We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.    We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.    Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.  Sincerely,  Mike	138

UNK:UNK	Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:  Producer/Wellhead Group  The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.  Strategic Asset  Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.  Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.     There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.   Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.  Louise & John	254

UNK:UNK	Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.    Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.  I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.  Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.	236

UNK:UNK	Philip,  What is going on down the street?  Curious to hear any perspectives you may wish to offer from the trading floor?  Enron stock is now lower than when I joined the company out of business school.  I imagine there are quite a few not so happy people these days.  We can relate somewhat over here at NPW with a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago).  Knowing you, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you down much.  I have taken a similar approach to our problems here at NPW.  Hope everything else is going well for you and the family.  Have you had the knee surgery yet?  Give me a call when you have a chance.

UNK:UNK	I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.  After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.  Ken Lay	180

UNK:UNK	"As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.  ?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.  We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period."	216

UNK:UNK	Good morning,  In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.    This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day.   If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate.   Thanks, Kam  x3-5781	119

UNK:UNK	--------- Inline attachment follows ---------  From:  </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=PALLEN> To: 'med@dyalroberts.com' <troberts@dyalroberts.com,> Date: Monday, November 26, 2001 7:10:01 GMT Subject:   Mike & Tony,  Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.    I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.  We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.    I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.  Phillip Allen 713-463-8626 pallen70@hotmail.com	238

UNK:UNK	"Phillip,  Here are the key points that came out of today's meeting:  1. We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the Knowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type.  2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content for these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next week to gather content and a second meeting for review.  3. We will change ""Gas Daily Risk"" to ""Intra-Month Risk"" throughout the simulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk?  4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too?

UNK:UNK	"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.    Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.  Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.          Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."	210

UNK:UNK	Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.    All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels.

UNK:UNK	Naomi,  The two analysts that I have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal  Apte. Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman. Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for  the first 9 months. I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent  category.  I just don't want Vishal  to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year.  Call me with questions.(x37041)  Phillip Allen West Gas Trading	82

UNK:UNK	Mac,   Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:    Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year      Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf    Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.      Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:   (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS  X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share    That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think  crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.   Current price 37  Nat. Gas 34  Crude  10   Total  81     Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this  looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine,  Tosco, and SLB?   Thank you,   Phillip	152
UNK:UNK	"Open the ""utility"" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it  is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1). You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we  have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.  Use the rates  described in the spreadsheet.  This is a great chance for you to practice  excel."	72
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week.   Then email the file back.	21
UNK:UNK	Lucy,   The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add  these modifications:   1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It  should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.   2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.   =e6-g6.   3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width  is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the         letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.   4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to  this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.  Phillip	129
UNK:UNK	Brad,   With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial  manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an  associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a  commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to  others in that category at year end.     Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.   Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.   Let me know if there are any issues.  Phillip	90
UNK:UNK	Mark,   Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal  basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that  reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints  before and after bidweek.             The following observations can be made:    July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs  actual of .79    2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91    3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.    Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs  actual of .99    2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49    3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the  monthly postings    4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.        Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against  the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.

UNK:UNK	Larry,   Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development  opportunities.   I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were  built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for   around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated  that he had more units under construction that would be   available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different  from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor  plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.     As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.     Call or email with your thoughts.  Phillip	120

UNK:UNK	George,   Here sales numbers from Reagan:        As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The  1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the  units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units  under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with  competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals  actually done to date.      Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call  about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was  rejected on the De Ville property.  Phillip Allen	124

I want your input on  how to negotiate with El Paso.  Do we push actual value, seasonal shape, or  unwind costs?    Phillip	81

UNK:UNK	Bob,   Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her  efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the  gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling  group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti  was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she  would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the  traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information  has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size  of the west desk positions.    Please call to discuss cash award.  Phillip	118
UNK:UNK	Andy,   I spoke to John L. and he ok'd one of each new electronic system for the  west desk.  Are there any operational besides ICE and Dynegy?  If not, can  you have your assistant call me with id's and passwords.  Thank you,  Phillip	45
UNK:UNK	Bob,   Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy  Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment  to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM  to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.   If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this  time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.   She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.   Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr.  specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know  what is an acceptable cash amount.  Phillip	126
UNK:UNK	George,   The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other  investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background  information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.   Background Questions:    Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in  Creekside.   Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project  description, investors, business entity,    Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.   Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on  recent projects.    With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple  of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the  investors.     Preferable Investment Structure:   Developers guarantee note, not investors.   Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.   Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.           Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should  tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in  any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that  leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any  information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.  Sincerely,  Phillip Allen	204

UNK:UNK	Dave,  The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars  that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped  from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk  will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.     The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as  follows:  October 2000  $1,395,000 November 2000 $1,350,000 December 2000 $1,395,000 January 2001  $   669,600 February 2001  $   604,800 March 2001  $   669,600 April 2001  $   648,000 May 2001  $   669,600 June 2001  $   648,000 July 2001  $   669,600 August 2001  $   669,600 September 2001 $   648,000 October 2001  $   669,600 November 2001 $   648,000 December 2001 $   669,600  This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by  the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day  (Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA  Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.  Let me know if you disagree.  Phillip	194

Note that the construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.  Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.  It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.  I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are $1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3 bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.      - winmail.dat"	230

UNK:UNK	"Folks,  I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I think will be interesting to the group.  I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.  I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks.  Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.   <A HREF=""http://www.romanconcrete.com/"">Roman Concrete Research by David Moore</A>   Regards,  Harry Francis"	181

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is a new file for 12/15.     For the rentroll for 12/08 here are my questions:   #23 & #24 did not pay.  Just late or moving?   #25 & #33 Both paid 130 on 12/01 and $0 on 12/08.  What is the deal?   #11  Looks like she is caught up.  When is she due again?   Please email the answers.  Phillip	62
UNK:UNK	Lucy,   I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated.        The critical information is  1.  Move in or lease start date       2.  Lease expiration date       3.  Rent       4.  Deposit       If you have the info you can   fill in these items  1.  Number of occupants       2.  Workplace           All the new leases should be the long form.     The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated  back in October are  #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38.      I really need to get this by tomorrow.  Please use the rentroll_1215 file to  input the correct information on all these tenants.  And email it to me  tomorrow.  You should have all this information on their leases and  applications.

UNK:UNK	Steve,   I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If  you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.          As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                     This creates a shortage in later months.   2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                         Specific questions should include:      1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage?    2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system.          I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less.   3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating  rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market  and the       consumer has benefitted.     Call me if you need any more input.   Phillip	242
UNK:UNK	Jeff,  Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I  have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out  tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility  connections?  Other rezoning costs?    What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I  owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this  property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes  once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him  grazing rights?  What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and  annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and  American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we  are pushing the process as fast as we can.  Phillip	154

UNK:UNK	"Jim,   I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I  described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in  San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a  couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like  to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not  require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to  structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has  been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the  equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this  nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to  permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be  important to banks.    I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer  email or fax his financial statement to you.   Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.   Phillip Allen"	182
UNK:UNK	Gentlemen,   I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure  and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.  Regarding the financing,  I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.  I have  sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information  on you.  Can you please send it to him.  His contact information is:  phone  (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net.   I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I  hope to pull that together this afternoon.   I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He  was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the  bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.  I think we should discuss  these procedures in advance.   Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.  Phillip	156

UNK:UNK	Questions about 12/29 rentroll:   There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other  for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?   Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For  what periods?    What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!   That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money  and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first  asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like  leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the  apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly  inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has  been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.  I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so  I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this  right?  Has the deposit been made yet?    A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.  Phillip	198
UNK:UNK	Frank,  Did you receive the information about the San Marcos apartments.  I have left  several messages at your office to follow up.  You mentioned that your plate  was fairly full.

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There  are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all  the cold weather.  You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.   This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.  I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We  also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need  to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write  something today.    Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start  collecting.  Phillip	118

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  #32 and #29 are fine.    #28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid  260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He  either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the  middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a  big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.  Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent  you this morning.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon.  Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626   Phillip	245

UNK:UNK	Jeff,  I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several  reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the  large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer  are the three biggest concerns.    What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the  buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due  until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the  property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make  the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance  is pushing too far.  Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the  earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?  Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New  Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get  started on the list.  Email or call  me later today.  Phillip	207
UNK:UNK	Jeff,  My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a  sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only  require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I  would net around $20K cash.    You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or  higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the  New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.   Phillip	92

UNK:UNK	Jacques,  Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?    The key business points are:  1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate  2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million  3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.  4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?  5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.  With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a  solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes  costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I  would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax  all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the  checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing  but invoices were not being submitted.  Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some  tweaking.    Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 pallen@enron.com	174
UNK:UNK	"Lucy,  Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.    There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.  1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank  is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the  spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.  2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?  3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?  4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?  5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?  6.  #14  missed on 2/2?  7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?  8.  #20a missed on 2/2?  9.  #35 missed on 2/2?  My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.   You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on  some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the  bank deposit.  Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade  last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject  to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.  It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there  unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.  When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize  that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.    Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes  if you need to.      Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and  refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form  to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this  information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.  It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with  the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  He will know what I  mean.  Talk to you later,  Phillip	201

UNK:UNK	"John,  Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies  forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.  Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:  1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS,  TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the         parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and  TAGG but the issues facing         scheduling in Unify are grey.  2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up""  policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need  further      scrutiny.  3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical  imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?  4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training  courses, review progress and make cuts.  5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at  everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add     some value and direction to the group.   In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD  to work part time to get it done.  Phillip"	194

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The principal change is in the addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than sufficient, but there will be additional updates.  The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.  The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this loan is obtained.  Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.  George W.

First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in the transaction.  2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC)  will be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal.  3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as deferred profit has been acceptable.  Thanks,  Andrew Ozuna Real Estate Loan Officer 210-271-8386 ##	208
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:  #2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is  not on any rentroll that I can see.  #9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she  will start paying on #9  #15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to  collect the $95 in question.  #33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?  #26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.   Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.  #44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of  the year.  #33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't  see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?  The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to  figure these out immediately.  I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll  in case you need to research these questions.  I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be  able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary  on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.

According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.  Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however.  More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter."	238

UNK:UNK	Jacques,  I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of  value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to  use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey,  appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in  extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like  earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I  didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear  this up.  Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.   Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and  the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand,  conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was  clean.  What is your inclination?  Call as soon as you have a chance to review.  Phillip	169
UNK:UNK	Jacques,  Still trying to close the loop on the $15,000 of extensions.  Assuming that  it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents  need to be completed to convey the partnership done.

Let me know if  there is a reason I should not do this.  Thanks for all your help so far.  Between your connections and expertise in  structuring the loan, you saved us from getting into a bad deal.

UNK:UNK	Greg,  Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to  replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than  the full replatting process of 3 weeks?  Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the  plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes  across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for  the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.  Phillip	90

UNK:UNK	John,  Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of  course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing  contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still  wants to receive this payment.  Phillip	49

UNK:UNK	Greg,  Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:  Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf  (rentable)  What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?  Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2%  overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.  Why is profit only 4%?   Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.  What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to  boost loan amount but not a real cost?  Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who  receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?  Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?  What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts  NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40%  expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage  would only be 1.16.  Talk to you this afternoon.  Phillip	189

UNK:UNK	Jacques,  Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and  architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written  personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the  engineer. I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the  partnership.    I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the  partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been  conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.  Let me know what you think.  Phillip	116

UNK:UNK	Reagan,  I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.  Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?  What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA  221(d) loans?    Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market  quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:    5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment   2%- overhead   4%- profit  I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an  extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even  reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only  generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about  such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down  to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?  I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you  local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of  the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.  Phillip	199

They were polite regarding  asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to  listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to  protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality  agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable  us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder  value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by  reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a  weather product.  As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other  candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy  to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our  opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we  implement our strategy in California.  Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset  management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to  systematically identify and work through all the candidates.   Laird	226
UNK:UNK	John,  Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith  said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should  receive the same signing incentives as Keith.    Phillip	33
UNK:UNK	Reagan,  I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on  Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned  I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get  back in touch with you once he is finished.  Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager  from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable  with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp  Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid  for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am  still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local  relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final  determination on unit mix and site plan.  Phillip Allen	152
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is the rentroll from last friday.    The closing was to be this Thursday but it has been delayed until Friday  April 20th.

UNK:UNK	Johnnie,  Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic  about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels  into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my  budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing  the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.   However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.  I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this  product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you  that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously  consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in  cost over stick built.  Please email your cost estimates when complete.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen	154

UNK:UNK	"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.    Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.  Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.          Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."	210

UNK:UNK	"John,  Two items:  1.  I spoke to John McKay about Sumas.  His views seem well thought out.  He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40 	His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium. 	In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book.     2.  I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues."	199

By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies ""to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports.""

Subject:	Mid C New deals Sept 24  Phillip, here is the breakdown on new deals and option values for Sept 24.  Options:  Sold put with strike of 150 and volume of 30,800 Sold put with strike of 220 and volume of 92,400 Buy put with strike of 175 and volume of 61,600 Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30,800 Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30,800 Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30,800  Total new deal value $(3,552,534)  Value in exercising of deals (liquidations) $3,642,100  Net value to book = $89,566  The reason for the difference in new deal value for LT - NW between the new deal report and the DPR of approx $(2,290,630) was due to the fact that one of the swaps that was entered for the exercised options was incorrect. The correct value was determined by running a minibook and the difference was $(2,290,630) and so the new deal value was adjusted accordingly.  John"	201

My name is Nancy Turner, and I have recently joined Kristin Walsh's competitive analysis group where I follow gas industry issues.   As you may recall, earlier this summer we informed you that El Paso's line 1110 had been brought down for repair, pigging and OPS review.  Our sources at El Paso and OPS have indicated to us this week that line 1110 is expected to come back online on September 1st.  We understand that the throughput on the entire system at that time should be at least 920 Mmcf/d (same as before it went offline). However, there is a strong possibility that OPS may grant the system permission to return to it's full capacity at 1.1 Bcf/d on September 1st.  We are trying to obtain more information on the capacity issue and hope to have this confirmed early next week.  We will keep you posted, but if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at X 51623 or Kristin at X 39510.

Every time we transact, ENA's Confirmation Group needs to know from whom to expect payment, i.e. San Diego Gas & Electric.

UNK:UNK	Gary,  Can you call me to discuss the panel quote for the Allen residence issued to Johnnie Brown?  In April you worked up a quote for $20,000.  The dimensions of the house have not changed.

UNK:UNK	"Richard,  I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.  I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.  That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?   Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference.  Thank you for your help.  Phillip Allen pallen@enron.com 713-853-7041"	245

The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on.  $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI.  I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon.

UNK:UNK	Tony,  Here is the completed worksheet.  I also attached both a plumbing and an electric worksheet.    I spoke to Steve Chapman with the panel company in Kerrville.  He has a complete set of plans plus an engineers drawing of the slab.  I let him know that you would swing by and pick them up.  He said he knew Mike.

UNK:UNK	Mike & Tony,  Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.    I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.  We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.

UNK:UNK	Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.  As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.    My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.	140

UNK:UNK	Tim,  Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.  On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?  Thank you,  Phillip	102

UNK:UNK	Gary,  I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.

Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.    Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?

UNK:UNK	Ned,  Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.  Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.  I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.  Phillip Allen	129

UNK:UNK	Johnnie,  Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.  I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.

UNK:UNK	Jeff,  I received the fax from Velasquez Masonry for $11,000.  He is proposing to do work on nine buildings.  From the memo from the city it sounds like 33,34,35, and 42 are the units that are at risk for collapse.  I don't want to pay for any discretionary work.  Also, I am still waiting for a quote from another mason.    I am willing to offer $5,000 toward the repair and removal of rock in return for the release prepared by Jacques.  With regard to the utilities I want to have them transferred on Monday the 21st.  That will be one month that the utilities have been in my name.  It needs to be clear that I will net that month's electric and water against the $5,000 for the rock.  If she is willing to take the money for repairs we should be able to wrap things up immediately.  If not we will have to continue negotiations, but the utilities still need to be transferred.

UNK:UNK	Adrianne,  Last night I spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track, Emil Carlsson and Thomas Considine.  Emil is currently tutoring at Hofstra after leaving an option trading position.  I would recommend bringing Emil to Houston for further interviews based on his technical knowledge.  The biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation.  Thomas was working as an equity market maker.  He is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise.  He is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades.  The trading track would be an excellent match for his desires.  I would also recommend bringing Thomas to Houston for further consideration.  Phillip	118

UNK:UNK	"Jeff,   The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20.  You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.  Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.

UNK:UNK	Larry,   Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development  opportunities.   I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were  built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for   around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated  that he had more units under construction that would be   available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different  from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor  plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.     As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.

UNK:UNK	Mark,   Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal  basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that  reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints  before and after bidweek.             The following observations can be made:    July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs  actual of .79    2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91    3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.    Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs  actual of .99    2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49    3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the  monthly postings    4.

UNK:UNK	Lucy,   The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add  these modifications:   1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It  should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.   2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.   =e6-g6.   3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width  is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the         letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.   4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to  this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.  Phillip	129

UNK:UNK	Mac,   Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:    Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year      Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf    Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.      Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:   (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS  X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share    That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think  crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.   Current price 37  Nat. Gas 34  Crude  10   Total  81     Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this  looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine,  Tosco, and SLB?   Thank you,   Phillip	152

Note that the construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.  Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.  It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.  I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are $1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3 bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.      - winmail.dat"	230

UNK:UNK	Scott,   I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think  I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from  him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some  price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large  enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.   The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage  the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.  Phillip	105

UNK:UNK	Lucy,   Click on this attachment to see the format to record expenses.  You can keep  a log on paper or on the computer.  The computer would be better for sending  me updates.

UNK:UNK	Jeff,   I will respond to the offer on Monday.  There is a $35 Million expansion  adding 250 jobs in Burnet.  I am tempted to hold for $3000/acre.  Owner  financing would still work.   Do you have an opinion?  Phillip	39
UNK:UNK	Al,  I was glad to hear from you.  I hope we can put the past behind us.  Sounds  like you have been busy.  Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your  email all is well with you.   That's great.    We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.   What's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike  riding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.  My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on  maintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical  cyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.   He never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial  Park on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the  road.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.  I would like to hear more about your new job.  Maybe we could grab lunch  sometime.    Phillip	187
UNK:UNK	Mary,  If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6  or 12 months.  6 month payout would be $190/month.   12 month payout would be $95/month.  Your choice.  I would like it if you  could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so.  Does $10/hr sound  fair?  We can apply it to the loan.  Phillip	67

They were polite regarding  asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to  listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to  protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality  agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable  us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder  value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by  reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a  weather product.  As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other  candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy  to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our  opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we  implement our strategy in California.  Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset  management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to  systematically identify and work through all the candidates.   Laird	226
UNK:UNK	Kay & Neal,  Thanks for remembering my birthday.  You beat my parents by one day.    The family is doing fine.  Grace is really smiling.

UNK:UNK	$100 for the yard seems like enough for up to 12.5 hours.  How long did it  take him?  I think $100 should be enough.   Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if  you want to change from printing vertically  to printing horizontally.  Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want  your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print preview to see what your print out will look like before you print.  The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  A valve  adjustment might do some good.  It has idled very high for the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.

Saves on gas,  pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  Enron provides bike racks  in the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we  could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the  capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily  basis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike  at the designated outside racks.    Keep Pedalling - Lee	138

UNK:UNK	Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.   Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding  the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business  meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is  even desired or necessary.  As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try  and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working  and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet  just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a  round table discussion format.    My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and  jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.	140

Kipp Flores is  working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA  financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to  you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still  attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.  Phillip	82

UNK:UNK	Send to Karen Buckley.  Trading track interview to be conducted in May.	12
UNK:UNK	Tim,  Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our  Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.  On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its  forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been  lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the  second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The  outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some  additional insight?  Thank you,  Phillip	102
UNK:UNK	can you fill it in yourself? I will sign it.	10
UNK:UNK	I would look at properties in San Antonio or Dallas.	10
UNK:UNK	Gary,  I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general  contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from  the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within  his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe  he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.    Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from  the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you  please email them to me as well?  Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.  Phillip Allen	119

UNK:UNK	Ned,  Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for  this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current  summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made  to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal  capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and  withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60  existed at the time of this bid.  Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above  assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.  I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email  with comments.  Phillip Allen	129
UNK:UNK	Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?   Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed  price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?	36
UNK:UNK	Gary,  Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X  41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story  porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the  front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The  living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the  front porch.    I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow  and fax you a copy.

UNK:UNK	Frank,  The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially  set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever  the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very  short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not  match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.    Phillip	73

UNK:UNK	Johnnie,  Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic  about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels  into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my  budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing  the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.   However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.  I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this  product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you  that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously  consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in  cost over stick built.  Please email your cost estimates when complete.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen	154

UNK:UNK	Dave,  The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars  that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped  from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk  will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.     The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as  follows:  October 2000  $1,395,000 November 2000 $1,350,000 December 2000 $1,395,000 January 2001  $   669,600 February 2001  $   604,800 March 2001  $   669,600 April 2001  $   648,000 May 2001  $   669,600 June 2001  $   648,000 July 2001  $   669,600 August 2001  $   669,600 September 2001 $   648,000 October 2001  $   669,600 November 2001 $   648,000 December 2001 $   669,600  This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by  the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day  (Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA  Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.  Let me know if you disagree.  Phillip	194
UNK:UNK	Larry,  It sounds like Claudia and Jacques are almost finished with the documents.   There is one item of which I was unsure.  Was an environmental report prepared before the original purchase?  If yes, shouldn't it be listed  as an asset of the partnership and your costs be recovered?  Phillip	50
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  The spreadsheet looks fine to me.   Phillip	8
UNK:UNK	Bruce,  Thank you for your bid.  I have decided on a floor plan.  I am going to have  an architect in Austin draw the plans and help me work up a detailed  specification list.  I will send you that detailed plan and spec list when  complete for a final bid.  Probably in early to mid June.  Phillip	57
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is the rentroll from last friday.    The closing was to be this Thursday but it has been delayed until Friday  April 20th.  If you can stay on until April 20th that would be helpful.  If  you have made other commitments I understand.  Gary is planning to put an A/C in #35.   You can give out my work numer (713) 853-7041  Phillip	65
UNK:UNK	Thanks for your help.	4
UNK:UNK	Jed,  Thanks for the response.    Phillip Allen	7
UNK:UNK	Reagan,  I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on  Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned  I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get  back in touch with you once he is finished.  Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager  from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable  with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp  Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid  for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am  still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local  relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final  determination on unit mix and site plan.  Phillip Allen	152
UNK:UNK	"Jacques,  The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows:  Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225  is outstanding.  Kohutek- $2,150   Cuatro- $37,800   George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this  amount.  The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500  appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this  cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.  Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the   sellers to be executed.  Phillip"	113
UNK:UNK	Steve,  Thank you for the update.  The need is still great for this disk space.    Phillip	16
UNK:UNK	John,  Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith  said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should  receive the same signing incentives as Keith.    Phillip	33
UNK:UNK	Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is  the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the  floor plan. He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and  improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While  he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification  list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and  speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday  April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through  that day?  Also can you provide some references?  Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust  your bid.    Phillip	146

UNK:UNK	Jacques  I am out of the office for the rest of the week.  Have you ever seen anyone  miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks?  I assure you this is  unusual for me. Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday.  Call me on my cell phone if  you need me.  Phillip	57
UNK:UNK	Reagan,  I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.  Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?  What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA  221(d) loans?    Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market  quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:    5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment   2%- overhead   4%- profit  I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an  extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even  reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only  generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about  such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down  to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?  I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you  local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of  the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.  Phillip	199

UNK:UNK	Larry,  Jacques has sent a document to Claudia for your review.  Just dropping you a  line to confirm that you have seen it.  Phillip	24
UNK:UNK	Jacques,  Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and  architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written  personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the  engineer. I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the  partnership.    I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the  partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been  conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.  Let me know what you think.  Phillip	116

UNK:UNK	Greg,  Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:  Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf  (rentable)  What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?  Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2%  overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.  Why is profit only 4%?   Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.  What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to  boost loan amount but not a real cost?  Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who  receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?  Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?  What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts  NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40%  expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage  would only be 1.16.  Talk to you this afternoon.  Phillip	189

UNK:UNK	John,  Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of  course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing  contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still  wants to receive this payment.  Phillip	49
UNK:UNK	Reagan,   Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.   Specific features include:   Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs  Wood stairs  Two story porches on front and rear  Granite counters in kitchens and baths  Tile floors in upstairs baths  Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)  Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths  Solid wood interior doors  Windows fully trimmed  Crown molding in downstairs living areas  2x6 wall on west side   Undecided items include:   Vinyl or Aluminum windows  Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room  Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4  sides      I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.   The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof,  but   only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.

UNK:UNK	Greg,  Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to  replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than  the full replatting process of 3 weeks?  Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the  plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes  across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for  the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.  Phillip	90
UNK:UNK	keith holst sent you an email with the details.	9
UNK:UNK	"Jacques,  The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might  object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the  construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs  of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the  loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of  equity that would be required.   Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.  Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans,  engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are  in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking  directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on  what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.    The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we  need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and  give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.  Phillip"	181

Assuming that  it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents  need to be completed to convey the partnership done.

UNK:UNK	Jacques,  I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of  value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to  use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey,  appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in  extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like  earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I  didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear  this up.  Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.   Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and  the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand,  conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was  clean.  What is your inclination?  Call as soon as you have a chance to review.  Phillip	169

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is the rentroll.  My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.  Any special  reasons?  It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run  an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine. I will write you a letter of recommendation.  When do you need it?  You can  use me as a reference.  In the next two weeks we should really have a good  idea whether the sale is going through.  Phillip	87
UNK:UNK	I also need to know the base salaries of Jay Reitmeyer and Monique Sanchez.   They are doing the same job as Matt.	22

According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.  Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however.  More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter."	238
UNK:UNK	Thanks for the information.  It would be helpful if you would send the  detailed worksheet that you mentioned.  I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones  granted this January.  I have always elected to defer any distributions of  restricted stock.  I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be  kept in enron stock (50%).   Are you saying that all the previous grants have  fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?

UNK:UNK	Darrell,  Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his  excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the  land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like  to proceed and develop the property.    My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would  also like to compare construction and development services between what you  can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.   Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to  be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural  work to date.

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:  #2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is  not on any rentroll that I can see.  #9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she  will start paying on #9  #15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to  collect the $95 in question.  #33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?  #26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.   Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.  #44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of  the year.  #33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't  see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?  The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to  figure these out immediately.  I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll  in case you need to research these questions.  I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be  able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary  on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.

UNK:UNK	George,   The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other  investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background  information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.   Background Questions:    Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in  Creekside.   Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project  description, investors, business entity,    Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.   Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on  recent projects.    With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple  of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the  investors.     Preferable Investment Structure:   Developers guarantee note, not investors.   Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.   Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.           Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should  tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in  any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that  leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any  information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.  Sincerely,  Phillip Allen	204
UNK:UNK	George,  I can take a day off the week I get back from vacation.  Any day between  March 5th-9th would work but Friday or Thursday would be my preference.

First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in the transaction.  2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC)  will be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal.  3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as deferred profit has been acceptable.  Thanks,  Andrew Ozuna Real Estate Loan Officer 210-271-8386 ##	208

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.  The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this loan is obtained.  Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.  George W.

UNK:UNK	"John,  Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies  forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.  Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:  1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS,  TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the         parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and  TAGG but the issues facing         scheduling in Unify are grey.  2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up""  policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need  further      scrutiny.  3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical  imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?  4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training  courses, review progress and make cuts.  5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at  everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add     some value and direction to the group.   In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD  to work part time to get it done.  Phillip"	194

UNK:UNK	"Jaques,  After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different  definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a  superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third  party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management""  fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be  paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally  the builders profit of 1.4 million.  Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out  of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if  they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?   We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition  to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been  in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and  the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management  fee is included.  George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will  review and let you know what I think.  The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to  the 3 out 4 approval process.  Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only  true costs + 1.4 million.  Phillip"	252

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject  to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.  It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there  unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.  When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize  that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.    Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes  if you need to.      Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and  refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form  to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this  information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.  It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with  the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  He will know what I  mean.  Talk to you later,  Phillip	201

UNK:UNK	"Lucy,  Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.    There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.  1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank  is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the  spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.  2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?  3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?  4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?  5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?  6.  #14  missed on 2/2?  7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?  8.  #20a missed on 2/2?  9.  #35 missed on 2/2?  My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.   You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on  some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the  bank deposit.  Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade  last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.

UNK:UNK	Jacques,  Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?    The key business points are:  1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate  2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million  3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.  4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?  5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.  With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a  solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes  costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I  would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax  all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the  checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing  but invoices were not being submitted.  Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some  tweaking.    Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 pallen@enron.com	174

UNK:UNK	Jeff,  My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a  sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only  require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I  would net around $20K cash.    You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or  higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the  New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.   Phillip	92
UNK:UNK	Jeff,  I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several  reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the  large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer  are the three biggest concerns.    What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the  buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due  until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the  property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make  the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance  is pushing too far.  Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the  earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?  Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New  Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get  started on the list.  Email or call  me later today.  Phillip	207

I have  about $225K invested in the stagecoach,   it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.    I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee  and Jaques Craig can  work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a  second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%. Checkout this spreadsheet.      These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.    However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy  show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some  trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the  time and I don't trust  Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from  now on.    I will have the operating statements complete through December by this  Friday.    Phillip	185
UNK:UNK	---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/29/2001  12:14 PM --------------------------- To: <cbpres@austin.rr.com> cc:   Subject: Re: SM134    George,  Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders  profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon.  Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626   Phillip	245

UNK:UNK	Lucy,  #32 and #29 are fine.    #28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid  260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He  either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the  middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a  big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.  Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent  you this morning.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.   This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.  I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.

UNK:UNK	Questions about 12/29 rentroll:   There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other  for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?   Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For  what periods?    What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!   That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money  and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first  asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like  leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the  apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly  inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has  been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.  I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so  I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this  right?  Has the deposit been made yet?    A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.  Phillip	198

UNK:UNK	Gentlemen,   I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure  and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.

UNK:UNK	"Jim,   I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I  described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in  San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a  couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like  to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not  require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to  structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has  been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the  equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this  nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to  permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be  important to banks.    I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer  email or fax his financial statement to you.   Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.   Phillip Allen"	182
UNK:UNK	Jeff,  Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I  have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out  tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility  connections?  Other rezoning costs?    What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I  owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this  property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes  once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him  grazing rights?  What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and  annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and  American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we  are pushing the process as fast as we can.  Phillip	154
UNK:UNK	Steve,   I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If  you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.          As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                     This creates a shortage in later months.   2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                         Specific questions should include:      1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage?    2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system.          I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less.   3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating  rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market  and the       consumer has benefitted.     Call me if you need any more input.   Phillip	242

UNK:UNK	Lucy,   I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated.        The critical information is  1.  Move in or lease start date       2.  Lease expiration date       3.  Rent       4.  Deposit       If you have the info you can   fill in these items  1.  Number of occupants       2.  Workplace           All the new leases should be the long form.     The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated  back in October are  #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38.      I really need to get this by tomorrow.  Please use the rentroll_1215 file to  input the correct information on all these tenants.  And email it to me  tomorrow.  You should have all this information on their leases and  applications.    Phillip	126
UNK:UNK	Lucy,  Here is a new file for 12/15.     For the rentroll for 12/08 here are my questions:   #23 & #24 did not pay.  Just late or moving?   #25 & #33 Both paid 130 on 12/01 and $0 on 12/08.  What is the deal?   #11  Looks like she is caught up.  When is she due again?   Please email the answers.  Phillip	62

UNK:UNK	George,   Here sales numbers from Reagan:        As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The  1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the  units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units  under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with  competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals  actually done to date.      Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call  about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was  rejected on the De Ville property.  Phillip Allen	124

Is your position based on a legal or what you  perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a  project from scratch?

UNK:UNK	"Folks,  I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I think will be interesting to the group.  I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.  I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks.  Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.   <A HREF=""http://www.romanconcrete.com/"">Roman Concrete Research by David Moore</A>   Regards,  Harry Francis"	181

UNK:UNK	Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product  priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really  shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the  predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.    One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new  product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated  basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated  basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec  Nymex.  Any ideas?	118

UNK:UNK	I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL,  bandwidth).  The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level  than where my brain operates.  Still not quite sure what was going on there.   Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different  than previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, I  think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very  impressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact.    Sorry I ruined your run.

UNK:UNK	Greg: The guy from MG whom I spoke to about clearing was Alfred Pennisi, VP of  Operations.  He's out of NY.   He indicated his clearing costs were $3.10  versus the $4.50-5.00 I'm paying now.	40
UNK:UNK	Dave: A couple things about the limit orders:  1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open  should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible.   Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.   Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading  session unless specified otherwise.    2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.   When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000  increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the  quantity to be 15,000.    3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system  saying error trade, price not available.  4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price,  without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a  valuable feature.  Thx, John	175

UNK:UNK	I spoke to Alfred Pennisi from MG today.  MG clears their own trades and  maybe some for other customers.  He indicated that his cost for clearing is  $3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing  ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher  clearing rate and getting access to financing.  This is a question I hope  your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.    Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El  Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long  futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin  costs.	120

UNK:UNK	Just some feedback on our EOL discussion.  Whalley had similar thoughts about  how to address the ICE issue.  His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we  post 1/8 on ICE.  If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server  automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.  If someone betters that to 2 bid, we  immediately go 2.25 bid.  So we are always the best market on ICE so long as  it is not inside our EOL 2-way.  Thus the only way our best market shows on  ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market  gets shown.  If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was  that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.   Think about which  system you like better.  Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will  be implemented shortly.  I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing  a product this week.  The purpose will be to communicate about the importance  of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving  2-ways and killing the broker markets.	217

This still  will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to  reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed  transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I  would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we  deal with for obvious anonymity reasons.

UNK:UNK	Hello: There is one feature that has not been transferred to the new stack manager.   When I sort by both counterparty and product at the bottom of the screen, the  position summary does not sort by both product and counterparty, just by  product.  It would be very useful if you can replace this.  Thanks, John	55

UNK:UNK	"Frank: One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold  front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In  such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how  Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures  were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong,  and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position  currently.  But in the winter that may change. Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the  assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter  the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long  cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side.    While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the  payout probabilities may look like the following:  20%  $ -.05 40%     $ -.02 20% $ 0 19% $ .03 1% $ 1           	Enron North America Corp.

Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of the  memo attached) - John Lavorato and John Sherriff    3. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment  (Research/IT)  4. Test the new methodology (Market Risk, Traders)  5.

If you  do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out  today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that  might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some  serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign  whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many  things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance,  obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we  thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should  discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.

It got reception some places where mine did not and is more  user-friendly.  On a different topic...Greg talked me into upgrading to first class for a  flight in December to Australia.  He talked me into it by agreeing to pay for  half.   Cliff found it funny and agreed to pay for the other half.  I haven't  expensed it yet so I'm having Barbara send it on.

UNK:UNK	Please stop sending emails to jennifer_arnold to the following email address:  jarnold@enron.com.  You have the wrong person	19
UNK:UNK	Jeff: Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit  confused by the question.  In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market  conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas.   Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount  of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very  favorable. I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level. John	95
UNK:UNK	Andy: Just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed.  First, what happens  if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on  EOL?  Second, what strike are straddles traded at.  Are they set at the  nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid-market of the EOL quote?	57
UNK:UNK	Thanks for taking me in last night.  Sorry about being drunk and stinky.   My cab, that we called at 6:10, showed up at 7:02.  I was so pissed.	30
UNK:UNK	Dutch: The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to  two factors.  First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics  book due to the nature of the position.  I am currently using the ltx to hold  longer-term strategic positions.  The large increase in position is a  reflection of my view of the market.  Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was  transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until  this morning.  Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's  position and a corresponding decrease occurred today. John	107

UNK:UNK	Andy: This past weekend we released a new version  of the EOL software that,  unfortunately, had a bug.  The effect was to lengthen the time delay between  numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an  unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades.  We made the  decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until  the fix could be made.  I do not anticipate this to be a concern going  forward.  Thanks for the feedback.

Its been a long time since we talked, but a lot has happened. But the most important thing has been my decision to join Enron.

UNK:UNK	Jeff: To explain the P&L of -349,000  :  We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing  in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back  rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.   The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is  pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and  vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.  Looking out for you bubbeh: John	96

The  area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group,  long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need  to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf  group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas  trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and  the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further.... thanks for the article.  john	97

UNK:UNK	Mike: Two questions regarding fees: 1.  What will you charge for placement fee on a 750,000-1,000,000 type  investment into the hedge funds? 2.  I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity.   However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that  Fidelity charges $147.50.  Is there any justification?  Please understand that my basis for developing an account with Paine Webber  is dependent upon an agressive fee structure.  I don't want to see my  above-market returns compromised by high fees. Thanks, John	96

UNK:UNK	What it's trading  what I think it's really worth  apr oct   540    500  nov mar 547    375 cal 2  491    400 cal 3   460    325  Obviously most bearish the further out you go.  However, the game right now  is not sell and hold...although it will be soon.  The game is where will it  be tomorrow and next week and next month.  The market is structurally short  term gas thanks to our friends from california.  where ca is buying power,  williams and calpine and dynegy dont care of the gas costs 450 or 475 or 500  or 525.  irrelevant.  so term is not going down in the short term unless the  front comes into the 400's and scares some producers to start hedging or we  or el paso can find fixed price lng to the tune of 250,000 a day for 10 years.

UNK:UNK	dinner or drinks tonight?	4
UNK:UNK	So my point shown a little bit right now..  Weather a little cooler for this  week.  Overall normal for 6-10.  JV up 12 cents.  Think just as customers got  totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all  the way down.  Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the  length.  This year trade not ready to get really short.  Not until healthy  inj in April anyways.   I think money from here will be made being short,  just question of what and when.  Think there'll be enough hedging demand to  keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level.    With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going  to dictate prices for next couple months.  I think it will be spec and  hedgers dictating.  Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying.   Leads to more upside potential in short term.   My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell  side leading to pressure on those spreads.  The california term power sales  have totally changed that.  Before, the only thing customers were selling was  cal 2.  Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from  california.  Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.  You have very valid points.    i like q/v more though.  I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that  with little downside.  Thoughts?	249

Would they be interested in the  same service we give Tudor, i.e do they want a salesperson to bring them  ideas from our various trading groups??  Do they want to trade on-line or are  they already??  Based on what you come back with, I'll give a call over there and see how I  can resurrect the ISDA negotiations and get them trading...  Talk to you Monday, CA	167

No commercial flights  would get us back in time.    Judy indicated it was fine if we caught a ride on the way back, so my  contacts in NY booked the trip, including buying game tickets.  I am now  hearing that you may be leaving early Sunday night.  I was just wondering if  your plans had firmed up.  Obviously, it would be tremendously helpful to me  if the plane were leaving after the game.    Please advise, John	149

UNK:UNK	a couple more thoughts.  certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to  switching and slowdown in economy.  Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing  plants for instance.  switching is significant and has led to cash in the  gulf expiring weak everyday.  gas daily spread to prompt trading at  $1....need some very cold weather to justify that.  this seems to be the test  of the next 3-5 days.   Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management  keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too  many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub.  unless we get some crazy  prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.    funny watching the flies in the front.  Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50  friday morning.  probably worth 1.30 now.  crazy.  people have seen each  front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h.    what's the thoughts on distillates...  is it tight enough such that gas  switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market  too oversupplied to care?	193

UNK:UNK	Mike- I have their trader coming into the office tomorrow- they are a macro  fund (they manage Harvard's endowment fund) that trades commodities- mostly  crude and metals.  I want to get them into some gas and power trades.   Specifically, I want to get them into the short Rockies trade for the summer  that we have Tudor in.    Johnny recommended I have you speak to them- can you give me a few minutes  during the day to talk to them about the west in general.  I have him in all day- we are sitting with Mike Roberts to do the weather  update from 6 am-7:30 - would be great if we could get you between 7:30 and  8:30 am.

UNK:UNK	a couple more thoughts.  certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to  switching and slowdown in economy.  Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing  plants for instance.  switching is significant and has led to cash in the  gulf expiring weak everyday.  gas daily spread to prompt trading at  $1....need some very cold weather to justify that.  this seems to be the test  of the next 3-5 days.   Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management  keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too  many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub.  unless we get some crazy  prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.    funny watching the flies in the front.  Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50  friday morning.  probably worth 1.30 now.  crazy.  people have seen each  front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h.    what's the thoughts on distillates...  is it tight enough such that gas  switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market  too oversupplied to care?	193
UNK:UNK	amazing how with cash futures at $1 and the back such a piece that f/g under  such pressure.  month 2 has been the strongest part of the board all year.    will be interesting to see what happens when h/j is prompt.  could j actually  be strong?  seems like of the spreads on the board the best risk reward is in  f/g.  a little worried about having the z/f effect again.  that is, all spec  length trying to roll and funds trying to roll  at the same time leading to  some ridiculous level at expiry.  any thoughts?     slafontaine@globalp.com on 12/08/2000 12:05:54 PM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc:   Subject: re:summer inverses    i suck-hope youve made more money in natgas last 3 weeks than i have. mkt shud be getting bearish feb forward-cuz we already have the weather upon us-fuel switching and the rest shud invert the whole curve not just dec cash to jan  and feb forward???? have a good weekend john	175

UNK:UNK	I'm not sure if you have heard our fun news yet, but Rob and I are moving to Boston at the first of the year!!  I will be working remotely for HBK while looking for something new up there. Rob is continuing his career with Fidelity, though in a much more convenient location.  The only downside is he will actually have to go into the office every day!  We would love to see everybody before we leave, though it may not be possible with the holidays.  I'll be back in Dallas once a week in January and February, so we could plan to get together during one of those trips. But before that time, Rob and I will be with a group of friends from HBK at Martini Ranch on Thursday, December 14th right after work.  I'm sure we'll be there late, given my love of martinis, so please stop by if you can.  Regardless, I really want to stay in touch with my Texas friends, so make sure and send me your updated contact information if anything has changed in the last year.  Please pass this on to people who I may have inadvertently missed or I did not have their current email address.  Cheers, Heather Robertson    P.S. By the way, our house is on the market right now, so if you know of anyone looking, please tell them about it.  The address is 6815 Vivian Avenue, Dallas, 75223 and can be seen on www.ebby.com.	253

UNK:UNK	The attached report contains an analysis of fuel switching capability. It  also details one  of the current problems with EIA data. The EIA data   contains FERC form I data. Once generation is sold its fuel consumption is no  longer reported to the DOE. Hence an analysis of the DOE cost  and quality of  generation fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data. WEFA gets  around this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data. After 1998, there were  significant sales of generation due to the ongoing legislation and  deregulation at the state level.    - NGM11_00.pdf	96

UNK:UNK	The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separate  unique deal.  An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November  8th, 2000.  It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and  Q86409.4.  These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore  count as a total of four deals.       We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as  just one large deal with 4 different parts.  Unfortunately,  the EOL  Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals  are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.  Since this  currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most  conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.  This results  in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.  If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.  Pete Berzins x57597	164
UNK:UNK	Dear Mr.. Lavorato,  The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange/ ACCT # 12307915.  Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank.  2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient.  For any further questions, please call the accounts department at WSEX.  REGARDS MARIA.

I assume it is the former, not the  latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the  latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't  matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the  average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let  me know.  Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the  settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.

UNK:UNK	Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product  priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really  shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the  predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.    One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new  product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated  basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated  basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec  Nymex.  Any ideas?	118

UNK:UNK	Greg: The guy from MG whom I spoke to about clearing was Alfred Pennisi, VP of  Operations.  He's out of NY.   He indicated his clearing costs were $3.10  versus the $4.50-5.00 I'm paying now.	40
UNK:UNK	Dave: A couple things about the limit orders:  1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open  should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible.   Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.   Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading  session unless specified otherwise.    2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.   When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000  increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the  quantity to be 15,000.    3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system  saying error trade, price not available.  4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price,  without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a  valuable feature.  Thx, John	175

UNK:UNK	I spoke to Alfred Pennisi from MG today.  MG clears their own trades and  maybe some for other customers.  He indicated that his cost for clearing is  $3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing  ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher  clearing rate and getting access to financing.  This is a question I hope  your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.    Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El  Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long  futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin  costs.	120

UNK:UNK	Just some feedback on our EOL discussion.  Whalley had similar thoughts about  how to address the ICE issue.  His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we  post 1/8 on ICE.  If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server  automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.  If someone betters that to 2 bid, we  immediately go 2.25 bid.  So we are always the best market on ICE so long as  it is not inside our EOL 2-way.  Thus the only way our best market shows on  ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market  gets shown.  If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was  that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.   Think about which  system you like better.  Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will  be implemented shortly.  I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing  a product this week.  The purpose will be to communicate about the importance  of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving  2-ways and killing the broker markets.	217

UNK:UNK	Mr. Dyson:  Jennifer Medcalf asked me to forward to you the following brief overview of  Enron's relationship with Continental.  Please feel free to contact Tracy  Ramsey directly at #(713)-646-8311 with any further questions regarding  Enron's buy side relationship  with Continental.   Ramsey is the Global  Strategic Sourcing, Portfolio Leader, who manages the Continental  relationship.  Enron Buy Side with Continental:  Current Enron US spend on Continental airline tickets was approximately $40  million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six months of 2000.    Enron Sell Side with Continental:  Additionally, Enron has a strong relationship with Continental's Fuel  Management company.  Specifically, Enron has been hedging Continental's crude  oil over the past 2+ years.  Value to Enron has been over $9 million; value  to Continental has been over $45 million since 1999.  Enron Global Markets is  currently exploring several other business propositions with Continental  Airlines in the following areas of financial risk management:  weather  derivatives, plastics hedging, and on-line jet swaps.  Enron Energy Services  is exploring an energy (electric commodity) deal with Continental as well.  Mr. Dyson, please don't hesitate to call if I can be of further assistance  regarding these sell side opportunities.

UNK:UNK	Although I would prefer to see the counterparty name for failed transactions,  it is not of great importance and I certainly understand a third party system  not supplying us with that info.     Andy Zipper@ENRON 07/31/2000 01:51 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Houston Street  John,  As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street,  whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was  that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care  whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we  could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still  will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to  reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed  transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I  would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we  deal with for obvious anonymity reasons. I would really appreciate your  thoughts/concerns.  -Andy	192

UNK:UNK	"Frank: One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold  front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In  such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how  Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures  were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong,  and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position  currently.  But in the winter that may change. Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the  assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter  the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long  cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side.    While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the  payout probabilities may look like the following:  20%  $ -.05 40%     $ -.02 20% $ 0 19% $ .03 1% $ 1           	Enron North America Corp.

Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of the  memo attached) - John Lavorato and John Sherriff    3. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment  (Research/IT)  4. Test the new methodology (Market Risk, Traders)  5.

If you  do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out  today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that  might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some  serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign  whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many  things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance,  obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we  thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should  discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.

UNK:UNK	Hello: A recent posting on the Enron bulletin board indicated that you are looking  for academic tutors.  I may be available to help at nights in math.  Can you  please respond with details about the program, how old the kids are, the  commitment required, etc. Thanks, John Arnold	48
UNK:UNK	Frank: Just following up on two topics. One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact  his P&L is never close to that.  Can you check that his exotics book  positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.  Second:  Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer  term Vol problem until we change formulas?  John	70
UNK:UNK	Per: Can you give the Campbell fund read-only access to EOL.  It may speed up the  process if they see they can trade pre-market. John	27
UNK:UNK	I spoke to Vlady this afternoon regarding the alternative VAR methodologies.   I think changing to a Riskmetrics historical VAR system is more defendable  and objective, will provide more consistent results, and will create more  realistic results.  I understand Vince has a similar opinion.    John.	44

UNK:UNK	Jeff,  The value that we are looking for is the annual spend from ENA (trading  floor) to have each trader access the Bridge Information System or Bridge  Terminal.  We believe that Enron would get this backbone connectivity from  Savvis.   This information is supplied by Bridge and has nothing to do with  the WebFN transaction done by EBS.   Any thoughts on where we can find the  annunal spend by ENA to gain access to the Bridge Terminals and their  information - we thought that GSS might have the annual spend numbers.     thanks for your help,  Kim	94

UNK:UNK	Dave: A couple of issues:  1.  We continue to have a number of transactions that fail because of credit  exposure.  These are companies that have excellent credit, such as Duke,  Dynegy, Equitable, Mieco, etc, but have a fixed credit line on EOL that they  blow through periodically.  They get a failed trade and it often takes 5-10  minutes to rectify the problem, at which time we've lost the trade.   We need  the major counterparties to have unlimited credit on EOL, just as they have  in normal trading.  2.  As a corrallary, I am under the impression that when a trade fails  because of credit, the counterparty does not get an explanatory error message  describing what happened and what to do.  When a credit failure happens, the  counterparty will often keep clicking on the same product, getting the same  error message	142

UNK:UNK	Please stop sending emails to jennifer_arnold to the following email address:  jarnold@enron.com.  You have the wrong person	19
UNK:UNK	Jeff: Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit  confused by the question.  In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market  conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas.   Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount  of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very  favorable. I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level. John	95

UNK:UNK	Andy: Just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed.  First, what happens  if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on  EOL?  Second, what strike are straddles traded at.  Are they set at the  nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid-market of the EOL quote?	57
UNK:UNK	Thanks for taking me in last night.  Sorry about being drunk and stinky.   My cab, that we called at 6:10, showed up at 7:02.  I was so pissed.	30
UNK:UNK	Dutch: The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to  two factors.  First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics  book due to the nature of the position.  I am currently using the ltx to hold  longer-term strategic positions.  The large increase in position is a  reflection of my view of the market.  Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was  transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until  this morning.  Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's  position and a corresponding decrease occurred today. John	107

UNK:UNK	Andy: This past weekend we released a new version  of the EOL software that,  unfortunately, had a bug.  The effect was to lengthen the time delay between  numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an  unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades.  We made the  decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until  the fix could be made.  I do not anticipate this to be a concern going  forward.  Thanks for the feedback.

UNK:UNK	Mr. Nowlan:  When we spoke several days ago, I had mentioned the meeting between Jeff  Shankman and Larry Kellner, CFO, at Continental Airlines.  The meeting had  been scheduled for December 11th, 2-3 PM in EB 3321.  I will know tomorrow if  this date is confirmed.  Following our phone conversation, I did follow up  with the persons you suggested -- Larry Gagliardi, Douglas Friedman and Mark  Tawney -- as I completed an overview of our initiatives with Continental.  The meeting on December 11th will enable Enron and Continental to continue  discussions on three initiatives listed in order of economic value:  (1) fuel  management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR  analysis.    In order to verify attendees at this meeting, Jennifer Burns suggested that I  follow up with you.  Please note the Continental attendees listed below.  Did  you want to have the same origination team at the meeting or others?  I look  forward to your response so I can coordinate with them and confirm their  attendance.  Continental had requested that we keep the Enron attendance to 3  or 4 persons; they will do the same.  Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:  Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)   We appreciate your suggestions. Thank-you.  Sarah-Joy Hunter Enron Corporation Global Strategic Sourcing Business Development #(713)-345-6541	232

UNK:UNK	Jennifer asked me to explain about the effect of the refinery fire.  The St. Croix refinery has their reformer offline.  The reformer is used to  convert straight-run naphtha into a high octane blending component called  reformate as well as some butane and lighter gases.  The effect would not  really be a reduction in gasoline, but a reduction in a high quality blending  component which would make it harder to make RFG.  As of this writing, the fire is out. If you have any further questions, feel  free to contact me.  Jim 36970	93

UNK:UNK	"John  Hope you're well.  We are doing some work here on the long term curve for UK natural gas and  would value your views on the long term NYMEX Nat gas curve. By long term I am talking 7-20 years.   Our thinking is that beyond the traded period of 5-10 years forward, UK  prices would at least partially reflect the long run marginal cost of LNG in  a ""globalised"" market provided US prices were not significantly above.  As we are currently working on some long term structured deals it would be  great to get your input on this.   Many thanks  Andy"	104

UNK:UNK	Jennifer: I don't think we have much interest in doing this interview since it  primarily pertains to our views of the market.

John      Jennifer Walker@ENRON 05/07/2001 08:57 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: RISK Magazine Interview  John: Kevin Foster with Risk Magazine is working on an article for the June issue  regarding Gas Markets in the U.S. Basically, he is interested in Enron's  opinion of:  1. Physical Supply/Demand of gas and how this is affecting financial trades 2. Where do we anticipate gas prices going over the summer? 3. The state of the industry--any major issues that may affect the market?  If this sounds like a story we would be interested in doing, please let me  know and I will coordinate a short phone interview with Kevin Foster. I know  it usually works best for your schedule to do this after 4pm, so please let  me know if Tuesday after 4 would be good for you.   Thanks for your help and please call me with any questions.

UNK:UNK	Hello everyone.  In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.   Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late  June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to  go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.   I would like suggestions as to:  1)  Where to go.  2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.  3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie.  climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.   4)  And any other ideas you have.  In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.   The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your  schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland,  Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.      Regards  John	165
UNK:UNK	Jeff: To explain the P&L of -349,000  :  We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing  in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back  rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.   The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is  pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and  vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.  Looking out for you bubbeh: John	96
UNK:UNK	The attached note lists conditions that can be used to verify that a given  vol skew curve does not generate arbitrage opportunities in a strip of option  prices.  If you have questions or want to discuss implementation, please give me a  call.  Bob Lee x35163	45

UNK:UNK	After our meeting with Dell on 10/27, I sent a request to Charlie Ball (works  for Kip) for detailed power data from TXU. Charlie delegated the task of  getting this data to Randy Don Carlos, who has yet to return any of my calls  to update the status of the request.  Charlie Ball left me a message this morning indicating that Randy Don Carlos  was leaving Dell at the end of the month. He indicated that he will get the  information to me as soon as he can. I'm not sure, but it seems that no one  has sent the request to TXU yet. TXU generally will send out data within 1-2  weeks of a request. It has now been 6 weeks since we asked Dell for the data.  Assuming Charlie actually gets someone to send the data request to TXU, we  should get something by the end of the year.  Similarly, Continental has not yet sent over data that they were to request  from HL&P. I talked with someone in Mark's group on 12/4, and she indicated  that they had the data, but their real estate group wanted to review it  before they sent it to us. On this one also, it is unlikely that any  transaction will get done in this calendar year.  Please call if you have any questions.	228

Would that be you?  Or do you have a legal department that we  should forward it to?  We initially changed the  name on it and had it signed under Enron Corp which is where the majority of  our Bloomberg contracts lie, but because you can actually execute trades from the system that you are now using, it  has to be under your departments name and we need someone to sign the contract.  Let me know.

I noticed the contracts have been received.  However, ""North  America"" has been crossed off the contract. That is the name it was signed under and still the current trading name for Emissions and Natural gas. Not sure if it was a mistake or not. Anyway - please get back to me when you can.

Patrick and I feel this call swayed a  bit off track, and would like to make some corrections to the messages that were delivered today.  Enron is looking for a much deeper and more strategic relationship with HP  than a quick storage trade. We see  value in working to define a big picture which both HP and Enron find rewarding. Ravi did a great job explaining our trading model, so now you understand the role of the trading desk. Our job is to  uncover how best to use the trading desk in whatever strategic structure we build together.  As we are both Fortune 20 companies, we feel there is a world of opportunity  for us together. Your internal initiative of ""always on"", fits well with our bandwidth and storage on demand initiatives. We look forward to working with  you to figure out the best way to put them all together.  ***********************************************************  Dale Clark Manager:  Enterprise Marketplace Solutions Phone:   (503) 886-0493 Fax:  (503) 886-0441 Cell:  (503) 708-6909 dale_clark@enron.net"	256
UNK:UNK	Mike: Two questions regarding fees: 1.  What will you charge for placement fee on a 750,000-1,000,000 type  investment into the hedge funds? 2.  I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity.   However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that  Fidelity charges $147.50.  Is there any justification?  Please understand that my basis for developing an account with Paine Webber  is dependent upon an agressive fee structure.  I don't want to see my  above-market returns compromised by high fees. Thanks, John	96

UNK:UNK	Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of  the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost  its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way.   Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play  that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a more  bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch out  below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the economy  is the 800 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint getting up.	117

UNK:UNK	"Bob,  I want to make sure I keep you in the loop on the EBS/BMC/NetWorks/Global  Strategic Sourcing interactions.  EBS has worked out an additional 25% discount, which brings the total  discount structure to Enron to a 45%-off pricing level, if EBS and Enron  aggregate their spend opportunity.  This should come as good news to anyone  at Net Works who might be about to implement a BMC solution.    Also, there is additional flexibility in the situation, in that BMC will be  willing to work with Enron business units with regard to the timing of their  software purchases as it relates to applicability in EBS' deal.  For example,  if Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their  current testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail  (or other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001  (the preference would be to get the ""buy"" done by end of 1st Qtr, if  possible).  This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with  their purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC.  I'm going to contact your leads (Randy, Bruce, et. al.) to let them know of  the additional possible discount and the relative ease of securing it...and  to also help make sure that what BMC is pricing out to all is the correct  application solution in each instance.  Thank you for your help and cooperation,  Jeff Youngflesh"	245

However, the game right now  is not sell and hold...although it will be soon.  The game is where will it  be tomorrow and next week and next month.  The market is structurally short  term gas thanks to our friends from california.  where ca is buying power,  williams and calpine and dynegy dont care of the gas costs 450 or 475 or 500  or 525.  irrelevant.  so term is not going down in the short term unless the  front comes into the 400's and scares some producers to start hedging or we  or el paso can find fixed price lng to the tune of 250,000 a day for 10 years.

UNK:UNK	dinner or drinks tonight?	4
UNK:UNK	So my point shown a little bit right now..  Weather a little cooler for this  week.  Overall normal for 6-10.  JV up 12 cents.  Think just as customers got  totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all  the way down.  Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the  length.  This year trade not ready to get really short.  Not until healthy  inj in April anyways.   I think money from here will be made being short,  just question of what and when.  Think there'll be enough hedging demand to  keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level.    With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going  to dictate prices for next couple months.  I think it will be spec and  hedgers dictating.  Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying.   Leads to more upside potential in short term.   My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell  side leading to pressure on those spreads.  The california term power sales  have totally changed that.  Before, the only thing customers were selling was  cal 2.  Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from  california.  Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.  You have very valid points.    i like q/v more though.  I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that  with little downside.  Thoughts?	249

UNK:UNK	We've started breaking out separate P&L's.  It's been a very difficult  process so far for a number of reasons.  The last processes will be  separating out the P&L on the executive reports and on VAR. That will happen  this week.  Meanwhile, the P&L will be retroactive to the start of the year  and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero  or an adjustment will be made to get it there.   At the end of the year there  will be a number next to Maggi's name that he will not dispute.  His  contribution to the fixed side when I'm on vacations or in meetings will  continue to be a subjective process.

UNK:UNK	"Bob,  I want to make sure I keep you in the loop on the EBS/BMC/NetWorks/Global  Strategic Sourcing interactions.  EBS has worked out an additional 25% discount, which brings the total  discount structure to Enron to a 45%-off pricing level, if EBS and Enron  aggregate their spend opportunity.  This should come as good news to anyone  at Net Works who might be about to implement a BMC solution.    Also, there is additional flexibility in the situation, in that BMC will be  willing to work with Enron business units with regard to the timing of their  software purchases as it relates to applicability in EBS' deal.  For example,  if Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their  current testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail  (or other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001  (the preference would be to get the ""buy"" done by end of 1st Qtr, if  possible).  This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with  their purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC.  I'm going to contact your leads (Randy, Bruce, et. al.) to let them know of  the additional possible discount and the relative ease of securing it...and  to also help make sure that what BMC is pricing out to all is the correct  application solution in each instance.  Thank you for your help and cooperation,  Jeff Youngflesh"	245
UNK:UNK	Jeff,  The value that we are looking for is the annual spend from ENA (trading  floor) to have each trader access the Bridge Information System or Bridge  Terminal.  We believe that Enron would get this backbone connectivity from  Savvis.   This information is supplied by Bridge and has nothing to do with  the WebFN transaction done by EBS.   Any thoughts on where we can find the  annunal spend by ENA to gain access to the Bridge Terminals and their  information - we thought that GSS might have the annual spend numbers.     thanks for your help,  Kim	94

UNK:UNK	Mr. Dyson:  Jennifer Medcalf asked me to forward to you the following brief overview of  Enron's relationship with Continental.  Please feel free to contact Tracy  Ramsey directly at #(713)-646-8311 with any further questions regarding  Enron's buy side relationship  with Continental.   Ramsey is the Global  Strategic Sourcing, Portfolio Leader, who manages the Continental  relationship.  Enron Buy Side with Continental:  Current Enron US spend on Continental airline tickets was approximately $40  million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six months of 2000.    Enron Sell Side with Continental:  Additionally, Enron has a strong relationship with Continental's Fuel  Management company.  Specifically, Enron has been hedging Continental's crude  oil over the past 2+ years.  Value to Enron has been over $9 million; value  to Continental has been over $45 million since 1999.  Enron Global Markets is  currently exploring several other business propositions with Continental  Airlines in the following areas of financial risk management:  weather  derivatives, plastics hedging, and on-line jet swaps.  Enron Energy Services  is exploring an energy (electric commodity) deal with Continental as well.  Mr. Dyson, please don't hesitate to call if I can be of further assistance  regarding these sell side opportunities.

UNK:UNK	Mr. Nowlan:  When we spoke several days ago, I had mentioned the meeting between Jeff  Shankman and Larry Kellner, CFO, at Continental Airlines.

Following our phone conversation, I did follow up  with the persons you suggested -- Larry Gagliardi, Douglas Friedman and Mark  Tawney -- as I completed an overview of our initiatives with Continental.  The meeting on December 11th will enable Enron and Continental to continue  discussions on three initiatives listed in order of economic value:  (1) fuel  management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR  analysis.    In order to verify attendees at this meeting, Jennifer Burns suggested that I  follow up with you.  Please note the Continental attendees listed below.  Did  you want to have the same origination team at the meeting or others?  I look  forward to your response so I can coordinate with them and confirm their  attendance.

UNK:UNK	"In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.  	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.      	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group."	163

UNK:UNK	John --   I appreciate your allowing us to use your enclosed office for Ken Lay video applications.  In testing the equipment today, I realized for the first time that our fiber feed involved that big black box that you've undoubtedly noticed.  I was unaware that that would be necessary.  We really view this as temporary because we are planning to move all video activity to the new building before the end of the year.  However, if you would prefer, I can request to have the box moved out and a fixture put in your wall.   Thanks again, John.  Vance Meyer	100

UNK:UNK	Hi John,  Just started over here at RWE Trading Americas, Inc last Friday.  Not sure whether or not you've heard of them before but they are the largest utility in Germany with natural gas, crude and products, power and coal trading in Europe.  They own 80 % of Consol, which is the largest coal producer in the world, and 100% of Nukem, which has or is supplying uranium to all the US nuclear power plants.  They also have approximately 130 mmcfd of Appalachian gas which, unfortunately, is under contract with AEP as of this moment.  Additionally, they've budgeted to make a significant acquisition in the US next year. Overall, they've got a good story to tell.  Anyway, I just wanted to let you know the latest and would like to buy you dinner the 16th or 17th of this month to catch up on things.  Let me know.	150

UNK:UNK	The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.  However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.  To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.	160

UNK:UNK	I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.  I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.	137

UNK:UNK	The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.    As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.  Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.
