GHOST:ghost	This document is an email from Dr. Charles Healy to Drs. Farmer and Saltmiras wherein Dr. Healy requests that Drs. Farmer and Saltmiras review the article that Dr. Healy has been asked to review: “you two would be the reviewers in fact and I would then collate your comments and be the reviewer of record.” at *1.
GHOST:ghost	This document is an email from Dr. Charles Healy to Drs. Donna Farmer and David Saltmiras wherein Dr. Healy informs Drs. Farmer and Saltmiras that their decision regarding study sent to Dr. Healy for GHOST:peer_review will determine whether the study will be published.
GHOST:ghost	This document is a peer review by Monsanto employee Dr. Charles Healy of a study titled “Cytotoxicity of herbicide Roundup and its active ingredient, glyphosate in rats”. The document contains recommendations for rejecting the study w9/12ich found substantial adverse cytotoxic effects associated with Roundup and glyphosate.
GHOST:ghost	This document is an email and from Dr. Donna Farmer wherein she informs John DeSesso that she “added a section in genotox from the Gasnier study ...see a attached a critique we did that I took that from. Am working on a section for gasiner in the mechanistic section. Also we cut and pasted in summaries of the POEA surfactant studies.” at *1. The attachment is a draft of the Williams et. al. study with significant edits by Dr. Farmer which is also challenged for confidentiality
GHOST:ghost	In these documents, Monsanto scientist David Saltmiras admits to writing manuscript of glyphosate genotoxicity literature with Larry Kier, a Monsanto consultant (MONGLY02145925). The email correspondence also details how adding scientist David Kirkland to the study would “add credibility.” (MONGLY02145918) “Adding David Kirkland as a co-author to both review papers would add £14,000 (pounds Stirling) to the project, which split by 25 seems a fair investment,” writes Christophe Gustin(Monsanto EU) in a discussion about possible co-authors for glyphosate genotoxicity literature.David Saltmiras writes that adding Kirkland’s expertise to the genotoxicity manuscript “comes ata premium”: “David Kirkland believes his efforts will be less than 10 days at £1,400/day(equivalent to $21,780 with the current exchange rate), so we are effectively doubling the cost ofthe combined projects, but reaping significant value/credibility from David Kirkland'sinvolvement. Given the growing number of questionable genotoxicity publications, in my mindthis is worth the addition cost.”
GHOST:ghost	This document is an email from Dr. David Saltmiras to Dr. Heydens wherein Dr. Saltmiras “Contact Wallace Hayes to determine his availability and fees for attending the meeting.”
GHOST:ghost	This document is a 2012 consulting agreement between Monsanto and editor of Food and Chemical Toxicology, Wallace Hayes for the period immediately preceding Mr. Hayes’s involvement in the retraction of the Seralini paper from Food and Chemical Toxicology.
GHOST:ghost	This document contains an email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Saltmiras expresses the following with respect to the recently published study in Food and Chemical Toxicology by Seralini: “Wally Hayes, now FCT Editor in Chief for Vision and Strategy, sent me a courtesy email early this morning. Hopefully the two of us will have a follow up discussion soon to touch on whether I C'I' Vision and Strategy were front and center for this one passing through the peer review process.... and what is that, Vision and Strategy? I alsosuspect this paper may be in our own best interests - the last rites for Seralini's few remainingshreds of scientific credibility.” at *2.
GHOST:ghost	This document contains email correspondence between Bruce Chassy and the Editor of Food and Chemical Toxicology, Wallace Hayes, wherein Dr. Chassy urges Mr. Hayes to retract the Seralini paper at Monsanto’s request (discussed above): “My intent was to urge you to roll back the clock, retract the paper, and restart the review process.” at *2.
GHOST:ghost	This document contains a series of email exchanges between various Monsanto personnel regarding letters to the editor of Food and Chemical Toxicology seeking retraction of a study by Professor G.E. Seralini. Mr. Eric Sachs writes about his efforts to galvanize scientists in a letter- writing campaign in order to retract the article: “I talked to Bruce Chassy and he will send his letter to Wally Hayes directly and notify other scientists that have sent letters to do the same. He understands the urgency...I remain adamant that Monsanto must: not be put: in the position ofproviding the critical analysis that leads the editors to retract the paper.” at *3, 2; see alsoMONGLY01045298 (below).
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains a Monsanto-led study testing N-ntirosoglyphosate (“NNG”) on mice. Before getting a pass from the EPA, Monsanto conducted this one long-term carcinogenicity test of NNG in mice. The testing was conducted outside of IBT laboratories (which Monsanto hadused for NNG testing until it was shut down due to fraud). This study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in malignant lymphomas in male mice. No evidence suggests this study wasever submitted to EPA.
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains an EPA paper entitled, ‘Guidance for the Reregistration of Pesticide Products Containing Glyphosate as the Active Ingredient’. The EPA initially required that Monsanto test for the carcinogencity of NNG in the 1970s and early 1980s. The testing for NNG by Monsanto was mainly conducted by IBT laboratories which was shut down in the 1970s due to fraud. The EPA determined that these NNG studies were not acceptable to show that NNG wasnot mutagenic. The EPA, however, did not require additional testing on NNG provided that Monsanto keep the levels of NNG below 1 ppm.
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains email exchanges between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Donna Farmer summarizes the findings of Monsanto’s expert, Dr. James Parry: “Dr. Parry concluded on his evaluation of the four articles that glyphosate is capable of producing genotoxicity both in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism based upon the production of oxidative damage.” at *3.
TOXIC:toxic	This document, from 1999, contains email correspondence from between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Donna Farmer writes: “I will not support doing any studies on glyphosate, formulations or other surfactant ingredients at this time with the limited information we have on the situation.” at *2.
TOXIC:toxic	In 1999, Monsanto hired Dr. James M. Parry, professor at the University of Wales, to conduct an internal (and secret) safety review of glyphosate and the formulated product. In the beginning of the report, Dr. Parry identified as the first deficiency in the data: “No adequate in vitro clastogenicity data available for glyphosate formulations.” He, thus, recommends that Monsanto “provide comprehensive in vitro cytogenetic data on glyphosate formulations.” He also concludes, “My overall view is that if the reported genotoxicity of glyphosate and glyphosate formulations can be shown to be due to the production of oxidative damage then a case could be made that anygenetic damage would be thesholded...it may be necessary to consider the possibility ofsusceptible groups within the human population.”
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains email correspondence between several Monsanto colleagues discussing the fallout from Dr. James Parry’s report on glyphosate (MONGLY01314233). Donna Farmer (Monsanto Toxicologist) writes: “right now the only person I think that can dig us out of this "genotox hole" is the Good Dr. Kier...I am concerned about leaving Perry [sp] out there with thisas the final project/his final impressions...” Stephen Wratten (Monsanto) asks whether Dr. Parry “ever worked with industry on this sort ofproject?” Later, Wratten intones that the Parry report is not useful for Monsanto: “I do not see thathe has stuck his neck out on anything at all controversial, and therefore, there is little value in thewrite-up as written that could be useful. Hope it didn't cost much...”
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains an email from William Heydens to Monsanto colleagues after reading the Parry report on glyphosate. In his correspondence, Heydens writes after reading the report: "We want to find/develop someone who is comfortable with the genetox profile of glyphosate/Roundup and who can be influential with regulators and Scientific Outreach operations when genetox issues arise. My read is that Parry is not currently such a person, and it would take quite some time and $$$/studies to get him there. We simply aren't going to do thestudies Parry suggests.
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel wherein it is stated with respect to Roundup surfactants: “While the tallow amine was considered toxic at 62.5 and 15.6 ug/ml, the C12 alkyl sulfate didn’t exhibit toxicity at any of the test doses. While both ofthese compounds produced a marginal response which didn’t meet the test criteria for a robust positive, they did elicit an effect which was judged to be an equivocal, but test article-related
TOXIC:toxic	This document is a study \u201csite visit\u201d from July 7, 2000 of the \u201cFarm Family Exposure\u201d study. Dr. Admits Potential for Data John Acquavella (Monsanto employee at the time) and John Cowell conduct the site visit. The Coaching in Monsanto report indicates numerous deficiencies with the study, including: \u201cProtocol amendments had not Glyphosate Exposure yet been forwarded to the study team from Exponent; Many of the urines were very spotty and we Study found one day's urine that was obviously doctored. As at the Minnesota field site, the field team is not reviewing the urines carefully and there is little, if any, coaching of the farm families; There were some obvious errors or missing entries in the questionnaires.\u201d at *7-8.
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Employee Expresses Mark Martens states: \u201cI don\u2019t know for sure how suppliers would react - but if somebody came to \u2018Serious Concern\u2019 Over me and said they wanted to test Roundup I know how I would react - with serious concern. We Plausibility of Roundup have to really think about doing formulations even if they are not on the market . . . glyphosate is Formulation still in there and could get caught up in some false positive finding. at *1.

CHEMI:chemi	This document contains a paper written by Mark Martens, Christophe Gustin and C. Bates on how the surfactants in Roundup formulations increase the absorption of glyphosate in the human skin. The paper includes the following passage: “Surfactants are able to increase glyphosate absorption through the skin by (1) removal of lipids(sebum) from the epidermal surface due to surfactant action, (2) increase of the hydration state ofthe skin (under closed exposure conditions), (3) increase of skin contact (spreading of waterdroplets by surfactant action), (4) increase of contact time with the skin due to decrease ofevaporation of water from the droplets containing surfactant (surfactant monolayer at surface ofdroplets slows down passage to vapour phase,) increase of sub epidermal blood flow due toirritant action of surfactant, (6) intraepidermal and sub epidermal intercellular water accumulationdue to the irritant action of the surfactant.”
CHEMI:chemi	These documents contain email correspondence (MONGLY03738295) between various Monsanto personnel regarding a Monsanto (MONGLY00888353) study on the dermal absorption of the formulated Roundup product as precipitated by the surfactant (“TNO Study”). Dr. Heydens expressed concerns with continuing such studies: “My primary concern is with the glyphosate in terms of the potential for this work to blow Roundup risk evaluations (getting a much higher dermal penetration than we've ever seen before.” at *1.
CHEMI:chemi	These documents contain email correspondence (MONGLY03738295) between various Monsanto personnel regarding a Monsanto (MONGLY00888353) study on the dermal absorption of the formulated Roundup product as precipitated by the surfactant (“TNO Study”). Dr. Heydens expressed concerns with continuing such studies: “My primary concern is with the glyphosate in terms of the potential for this work to blow Roundup risk evaluations (getting a much higher dermal penetration than we've ever seen before.” at *1.
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel wherein it is discussed that the Monsanto programs, including the TNO study (MONGLY00888353, challenged above), evaluating the absorption of glyphosate and formulations (including surfactants) will be ceased “because a further study was not likely to help us meet the project objective.” at *2. Abandoning this scientific inquiry, however, “[w]e are left behind with too many questions after all this.” at *1.
CHEMI:chemi	This document is an internal Monsanto summary of the “operator exposure when spraying Roundup under UK conditions.” at *1. It provides an explanation of measuring the rate of Roundup absorption using the UK POEM (discussed in the above MONGLY04107778 document).
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between Richard Garnett, David Saltmiras, Donna Farmer and other Monsanto employees discussing glyphosate ADME. Garnett writes that Monsanto “needs solid data for ADME arising from dermal exposure.” He continues: “The movement of glyphosate in the blood flow from dermal contact, is different to that throughoral or intravenous exposure. The little data we have suggests that the excretion is significantly more through the faeces than the urine...Dermal exposure is the greatest risk of exposure for operators. Therefore, we need to be secure on the ADME of such exposure.”Unfortunately, despite Garnett’s recommendation, Monsanto declined to do additional testing ondermal absorption because the potential of finding a new glyphosate metabolite was “too risky.”The issue of whether glyphosate is excreted through the urine rather than feces is importantbecause Monsanto only considers urine levels of glyphosate in an effort to underestimateglyphosate exposure and does not measure levels in feces. In their depositions, David Saltmirasand Donna Farmer both deny that dermally absorbed glyphosate is excreted through the feces.
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between Monsanto personnel wherein Richard Garnett acknowledges that: “The ADME has always been the weak link in our argument and the Spanish response highlights that we have not got rid of the problem.” at *1.
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between Maurice De Billot (Monsanto) and Christophe Gustin, wherein Mr. De Billot discusses the difficulties of dermal absorption using the UK POEM (The UK Predictive Operator Exposure Model) metric: “In Europe we are getting prepared to submit MON 79991 (720g/kg) for approval under the new Reg 1107/2009. We ran the UKPOEM model using a dermal penetration value of 3% and do not pass when applying 3.6kg/ha for the tractor mounted sprayer. I am aware of the set of studies that you ran on dermal absorptionusing pure K-salt and IPA-salt and also MON 52276 and MON 79351 which showed dermalabsorption values of 1%. Putting 1% in the model we get a good result, so will need to show thatthe 1% dermal absorption numbers are equally valid for the MON 79991 formulation.” at *2.
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence in which dermal absorption studies are discussed. Due to pending requests from two authorities (UK and Denmark), a dermal absorption study “for high load gel” is needed. Per Monsanto EU Regulatory Affairs Specialist Sarah Dreissens: “If we use the default value we do not pass the risk assessment.”
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains a segment of David Saltmiras’ deposition. The questioning centers on dermal absorption and excretion of Roundup. Saltmiras did not appear to have all the data: Plaintiffs Counsel: [Y]ou're aware that it's more appropriate to measure -- the excretion [of glyphosate] is significantly more in the feces than in the urine for dermal absorption of Roundup,right?Saltmiras: There is no scientific basis for saying that glyphosate absorbed through the skin isfound in the feces. That's utter nonsense. I don't know where you're coming up with this.
REGUL:regul	This document contains an email from Monsanto research scientist Stephen G. Rogers to colleagues regarding the nomination of Dr. Mark Martens to the Monsanto Fellow’s Program. The email lists among Dr. Martens’ most important contributions: “Developed the data to gain key EU scientific support that the reported genotoxicity of Roundup herbicide was due to secondary consequences unrelated to glyphosate, thereby preventing adverse effect on Roundup business.”
REGUL:regul	This document contains an email correspondence that confirms Richard Garnett was assigned the task of “coordinator and filter for glyphosate issues in Europe...” Among Garnett’s listed responsibilities – assemble a team to “kill” issues related to glyphosate that popped up in the scientific literature. This job was created in response to the Sea Urchin study which showed that the Roundup ingredients acted synergistically to affect cell cycle regulation. Marc, et al. PesticideRoundup provokes cell division dysfunction at the level of CDK1/cyclin B activation, Chem Res Toxicol. 2002 Mar;15(3):326-31.
REGUL:regul	This document is the custodial file for Dr. Mark Martens, Monsanto’s Toxicology Director, Europe/Africa from 1994 to approximately 2004. The document describes Martens’ job duties as “gathering (i.e. literature search, Monsanto studies, and commissioning of toxicology studies in contract laboratories), selection and interpretation of health effects data within the Europeanregulatory context ... positioning of cancer classification issues of herbicides ... and registration defense of Monsanto's pesticides in EU member states...”
REGUL:regul	This document contains email correspondence wherein Richard Garnett is described as being put in charge of protecting “tallow amine formulations” in Europe and to counter allegations of “synergistic effects of tallow amine with glyphosate.” Garnett was also key to managing issues with the toxicity of surfactants that have regularly arisen in Europe, but not the United States. Monsanto uses tallow amine as a surfactant in both Europe and the U.S., but Europe has beenmore vigilant in regulating this toxic chemical which is being banned later this year.
REGUL:regul	This document contains email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel wherein Richard Garnett states the following with respect to gaining favorable regulatory assessment using in-vitro data: “Cannot win the battle on science alone (40% science : 60% politics) - need an experimental front, supported by a critical review of the literature, and a communication campaign to promote the message. Goal: ‘the regulatory authority must have no doubts’”. at *1.
REGUL:regul	This document is an email correspondence between Dr. Donna Farmer and Steven Levine discussing the EPA Endocrine Disruption Program. Mr. Levine remarks that “They have made Gary Timm from OSCP [Office of Science Coordination and Policy] the head of the program at EPA NOT Jess Roland from OPP. This is not a good development and dramatically cuts our chance our chance for success.” at *1.
REGUL:regul	This document contains text-message correspondence between Mr. Daniel Jenkins, various Monsanto employees, and various EPA officials regarding regulatory aspects of glyphosate. In reference to the United States Department of Agriculture, Mr. Jenkins comments: “might want totell them we’re going to need their support for glyphosate...We’re in for a tough ride[.]” at *2. Mr. Jenkins also comments: “Jess is doing a nice job at EPA[.]” at *1. Jennifer Listello asks: “Is there anyone we can get to in EPA?” at *3. With regard to IARC, Mr. Jenkins comments: “Got john toagree to talk about how we might work together on changing IARC communication[.]” at *4-5.Mr. Jenkins asks Ms. Mary Manibusan (formerly EPA and co-chair with Jess Rowland on CARCpublication): “do you know folks at ATSDR in HHS?” Ms. Manibusan responds: “Yes. Wherespecifically...on Tox profiles?” After Mr. Jenkins confirms, Ms. Manibusan responds: “I knowlots of people. You can count o[n] me.” Mr. Jenkins informs her that: “we’re trying to doeverything we can to keep from having a domestic IARC occur w this group. may need yourhelp... I'll share some info, you tell me what you think we might be able to do, who you mayknow, etc ok?” to which Ms. Manibusan agrees. at *5. Mr. Jenkins also contacts Mr. Ty Vaughn:“I think we need to talk about a political level EPA strategy and then try to build a consensus planw Michael on several fronts: glyphosate...we’re not in good shape and we need to make a plan[.]”at *6. Following text messaging with Mr. Jack Housenger (EPA), Mr. Jenkins comments: “Spoketo EPA: is going to conclude that IARC is wrong. So is EFSA....pushed them to make sure atsdris aligned, said they would...they’re looking into getting a contact for me at cdc re biomonitoring” at *6-7.
REGUL:regul	“In response to our request to share the full report of mouse carcinogenicity study conducted with TAC's material in order for us to include TAC's data in the publication on glyphosate and cancer risk, TAC declined based on the lack of consensus among TAC members since FSC review is still underway and the original mouse data suggested some carcinogenic potential which was denied in the process of FSC review.”
REGUL:regul	In this document, William Heydens discusses EPA officials’ upcoming visit to IARC. Rowland is invited to participate in the IARC meeting as an observer. Heydens: “The 2 EPPA folks going as observers are Catherine Eiden & Jess Rowland. Catherine is a Special Assistant in the Pesticide Re-evaluation Division, and we all know Jess.”
REGUL:regul	This document details a number of goals to be pursued by Monsanto prior to and following the anticipated IARC decision. Under “Post-IARC”, the following objective is identified: “Orchestrate Outcry with IARC Decision a March 10, 2015”. at *5.
