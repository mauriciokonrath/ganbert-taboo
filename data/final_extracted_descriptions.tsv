UNK:UNK	Emails Between William Heydens, David Saltmiras and others Discussing Kier/Kirkland Study In these documents, Monsanto scientist David Saltmiras admits to writing manuscript of glyphosate genotoxicity literature with Larry Kier, a Monsanto consultant (MONGLY02145925). The email correspondence also details how adding scientist David Kirkland to the study would “add credibility.” (MONGLY02145918) “Adding David Kirkland as a co- author to both review papers would add £14,000 (pounds Stirling) to the project, which split by 25 seems a fair investment,” writes Christophe Gustin (Monsanto EU) in a discussi on about possible co- authors for glyphosate genotoxicity literature. David Saltmiras writes that adding Kirkland’s expertise to the genotoxicity manuscript “comes at a premium”: “David Kirkland believes his efforts will be less than 10 days at £1,400/day (equivalent to $21,780 with the current exchange rate), so we are effectively doubling the cost of the combined projects, but reaping significant value/credibility from David Kirkland's involvement.

UNK:UNK	Internal Monsanto Email From Richard Garnett: ‘Dermal Exposure is the Greatest Risk of Exposure for Operators This document contains email correspondence between Richard Garnett, David Saltmiras, Donna Farmer and other Monsanto employees discussing glyphosate ADME. Garnett writes that Monsanto “needs solid data for ADME arising f rom dermal exposure.” He continues: “The movement of glyphosate in the blood flow from dermal contact, is different to that through oral or intravenous exposure. The little data we have suggests that the excretion is significantly more through the faeces than the urine…Dermal exposure is the greatest risk of exposure for operators. Therefore, we need to be secure on the ADME of such exposure.” Unfortunately, despite Garnett’s recommendation, Monsanto declined to do additional testing on dermal absorption because the potential of finding a new glyphosate metabolite was “too risky.” The issue of whether glyphosate is excreted through the urine rather than feces is important because Monsanto only considers urine levels of glyphosate in an effort to underest imate glyphosate exposure and does not measure levels in feces. In their depositions, David Saltmiras and Donna Farmer both deny that dermally absorbed glyphosate is excreted through the feces.

Monsanto falsely asserted to EPA that the historical range was 0 -7.1% when the max was actually 4.7%. EPA called them out for it, as well as for their asserting a couple of inapplicable studies. The K&H 6.6% was greater than the historical range of 4.7%. Notwithstanding, EPA decided not to require the additional mouse study, an ongoing rat study would be enough.

After a thorough evaluation of the extensive package of toxicological data submitted to the Agency on glyphosate, and a review of critical, albeit limited, tox data on AMPA, the EPA concluded in the Glyphosate Reregistration Eligibility Document (RED) that the metabolite AMPA was not of toxicological concern and should be removed from the glyphosate residue definition, leaving the tolerance expression to be reflective of the residual level of glyphosate only…In order to maintain and improve Monsanto’s glyphosate position in the US and Canada, it is critical that PMRA’s position on AMPA move to where the EPA is currently, a position of no toxicological concern and removal from the MRL expression, without the need for any additional toxicity data on AMPA.” 153 Bates Title Description MONGLY00984223 8/24/2009
